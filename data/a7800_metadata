Like the original, this is a one or two player battle-action game where your jeeps (equipped with rocket launchers) defend war torn landscapes with 16 different terrains that are randomly chosen at the beginning of each level.\n\n\n\nThe play field is a top view of cities with road and building areas defined. Players (jeeps) and enemies (tanks) can only maneuver on the roads, however the enemy helicopter can go over buildings and roads. No shots by anything can go through buildings, as they are only valid over road areas. Debris left by tanks is sometimes destructive, so make sure to shoot them from a safe distance!\n\n\n\nThe object is to accumulate the maximum number of points possible. In a two player game, both players play simultaneously and neither player can shoot the other. The player(s) must avoid being shot or run over by the enemy tanks, and avoid being shot by the helicopter. If a player shoots a helicopter, the bonus level is incremented by 10 points. When the fifth helicopter is destroyed an extra jeep is awarded to the player who shot the helicopter the fifth time. (Bonus Levels: +10, +20, +30, +40, extra jeep and reset to zero). The player's turn is over when he/she gets shot by the tank or helicopter. In a two player game, the level does not reset and the player does not return (if he/she has any lives left) until both players are shot.\n\n\n\nIf a player shoots a tank once, there is a time limit to shoot the turret. If a player does not then shoot the turret, it will explode automatically and no points will be awarded.\n\n\n\nSkill Levels\n\n\n\nEach Skill Level starts the player at different points in the game (including the player's score):\n\n\n\nEasy: On the 'Easy' Skill level, there are fewer tanks, they don't shoot as often, move much slower, the turrets follow you very slowly, and the helicopter doesn't shoot often.\n\nNormal: The 'Normal' skill level is for players who are familiar with the game and features a good balance of difficulty and challenge.\n\nHard: On the 'Hard' skill level, there are many more tanks required to complete a level, they shoot much more often, move quickly, the turrets follow you immediately, and the helicopter shoots much more often as well. If you are able to get through a few of the more difficult levels, a second helicopter is brought out to further hinder you.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"true","DatabaseID":"123605","CommunityRating":"5","Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Robert DeCrescenzo","Publisher":"AtariAge"},"Asteroids":{"Name":"Asteroids","ReleaseDate":"1987-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Start blasting!

Now Earth is threatened by deadly aliens and you must use your creation to save the planet. The Sentinel absorbs energy from every power pod or energy capsule you shoot with your Atari light gun. When an energy source is hit, a beam blasts out from the Sentinel, strikes the target with hissing force, and draws energy back into your Sentinel. It's up to you to protect the Sentinel as it glides over the planets.\n\nThis was the only game for the 7800 that was originally released in PAL format only. Thanks to ResQsoft, an NTSC version is also available for gamers in the Western Hemisphere. Sentinel is a light gun game that is similar to Crossbow in the aspect that you are in charge of protecting your ally, in this case the Sentinel, from attack. The game features four stages, each which its own name and level boss. What makes the game unique is that shooting the large orange Sentinel acts as a smart bomb, destroying everything on the screen. While Sentinel is a very hard title to find in the wild in the Americas, this game is pretty common in Europe and can normally be purchased through online auctions at a reasonable price.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"22386","CommunityRating":"0.5","Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":{},"Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari"},"Sirius":{"Name":"Sirius","Overview":"Sirius is a long lost unreleased prototype developed by Tynesoft for the Atari 7800, possibly a port of the 1990 Amiga game Sirius 7. Sirius' existence has been known for some time, as a physical prototype has been in hands of a collector for years, but this prototype was known to be unstable and crash frequently. The source code for Sirius was discovered in 2008 and several 7800 enthusiasts were able to get it compiled and running properly on stock 7800 hardware.\n\nSirius is a horizontally oriented space shooter that will feel right at home to those familiar with games such as Gradius and R-Type. The game consists of four different levels, each with its own unique theme and boss. Sirius deftly demonstrates what the 7800 hardware is capable of and compares favorably with NES and Sega Master System games of the time. Unfortunately, Sirius is aggravatingly difficult and will require much practice and patience to succeed through all four levels.\n\nSirius is a single player game only. The difficulty level (easy and hard) can be selected via the left difficulty switch. Sirius has several different types of weapons power-ups. The first is a \"ghost ship\" that follows you and fires when you fire. Other power-ups include rapid fire guns and rapid fire plus spread fire. You can pick up one extra of each power-up type for reserve so that when you are killed you won't be quite so vulnerable. There are also diamonds that you can pick up but they don't seem to do much other than reward you 300 points.\n\nA partially compiled version of Sirius was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. It's a shame that Sirius was not released as it was obviously very close to completion and would have been a boost to the 7800 library.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"22387","CommunityRating":"1.5","Platform":"Atari 7800","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"5","Genres":{},"Developer":"Tynesoft"},"Space Duel":{"Name":"Space Duel","ReleaseYear":"2007","Overview":"Space Duel is a port to the Atari 7800 of the third generation of Asteroids-style shooters from Atari, following on the heels of Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe.
