You pick one of 24 fighters, compete in one of 5 locations from around the world, and re-create the Toughman tournament as seen on TV.\n\nThe boxing action is viewed from behind the back of fighter you control. Your fighter is rendered as an outline, so you can see what your opponent is up to and react accordingly. Toughman matches consist of three one minute rounds. Your goal is to KO your opponent by causing their stamina meter to decrease to the point where they fall down, or beating on them enough that you are scored the winner at end of the third round.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiH0VkUPPsg","DatabaseID":"9082","CommunityRating":"2.1363636363636362","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toughman_Contest_(video_game)","Platform":"Sega 32X","ESRB":"T - Teen","CommunityRatingCount":"11","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"High Score","Publisher":"Electronic Arts"},"Virtua Fighter":{"Name":"Virtua Fighter","ReleaseDate":"1995-10-10T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Virtua Fighter was the first of it's kind: A one-on-one fighting game featuring fully 3D environments and characters.

It is also reported that Sega of Japan were not keen on use of the \"Virtua\" in the game's name, possibly so that the game was not associated with Sega AM2's Virtua Fighter and Virtua Racing. An alternate box mock-up uses the title Virtual Hamster instead.\n\nIn August 2009, Ryo Suzuki of SEGASaturno.com dumped an early prototype version of this game. In it, the only selectable character is hamster, Chip, and there is only one empty level (though there are numerous non-moving 3D models of other characters and items dotted around the map). A resets the game, and B/C can be used to move the camera forwards and backwards through the tube.
