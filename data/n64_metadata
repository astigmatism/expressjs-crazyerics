DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, many hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the \"Silver Coin Challenge\". In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).\n\nThe game also features a strategic method of using weapons. Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times). This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later.\n\nUp to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game. There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).","MaxPlayers":"4","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXvzvNZYOjc","DatabaseID":"178","CommunityRating":"4.3423423423423424","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diddy_Kong_Racing","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"111","Genres":"Adventure; Racing","Developer":"Rare","Publisher":"Nintendo"},"Donkey Kong 64":{"Name":"Donkey Kong 64","ReleaseDate":"1999-11-22T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"K.

The Nintendo 64 GameShark was the most popular cheating device available for the system, becoming popular after well-known titles such as \"GoldenEye 007\" and \"\" were released. Because of the in-depth nature of these games, it allowed for many aspects of them to be modified to produce unique effects; for example, much unused content was discovered, such as a distant tower on the \"Dam\" level of \"GoldenEye 007\".\n\nThe Nintendo 64 Gameshark Pro featured an in-game code search menu. Version 3.3 also had a parallel port on the back, allowing the device to be connected to a PC. This was intended primarily to make entering large amounts of codes easier, but was also used for advanced hacking. The in-game code search required that an Expansion Pak be installed and that the game not be using it.\n\nThe Gameshark Pro had several advantages to earlier devices, such as being able to use hundreds of codes at once and save thousands of codes in the Gameshark cartridge. Previous devices, such as the Game Genie, supported as few as 3 codes at a time and had no save function.\n\nUnfortunately, the device was well-known for having numerous flaws. Physically, it was poorly constructed, lacking a proper cartridge holder which made it very unstable. It was also made from low-grade plastic and cheap components, which made it easily breakable. In addition, the software had numerous bugs. Updating the code list would frequently corrupt other parts of the list or the software itself, rendering the device unusable until it was connected to a PC and reformatted, if it was still able to even start up. It also often failed to remember which codes were selected between sessions, and had no protection against power failures - if the power was lost while the code list or software was being updated, the device was very likely to be rendered useless.","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NbK3eTSC7M","DatabaseID":"145187","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameShark#Nintendo_64_GameShark_Pro","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{},"Developer":"InterAct","Publisher":"Mad Catz"},"Gauntlet Legends":{"Name":"Gauntlet Legends","ReleaseDate":"1999-09-29T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Arm yourself and up to 3 friends, for adrenaline-drenched 4-player action in the legendary Gauntlet universe.

Its designer Kazutoshi Iida has described it as \"Populous meets Mario\". The player controls the Doshin as he tries to help, or hinder the islands inhabitants. Doing so causes the villagers to release love or hate, which Doshin absorbs. The two feelings cancel each other out, but if he gets enough of one type, he will grow in size. Doshin is the Love Giant, a yellow, featureless giant with a happy face and a few strands of hair. He is a benevolent, helpful being who, with his good actions, earns love from his people and increases in size (only for that day; by the next day, he is back to normal size). He can pick up people trees and other such things. Doshin can transform at will into his evil alter ego Jashin, the Hate Giant. In the GameCube version, he has wings and clawed feet and inspires Hate monuments that are slightly different from the Love monuments Doshin can earn. Jashin is known to be a destructive force to the natives, the exact opposite to Doshin's nature. With his bad actions, people show him their dislike, and he increases in size. The only thing the two giants have in common is that both have an outie belly button. Although he cannot pick up things, he can send streams of fire across the land, destroying structures in their way. Doshin and Jashin can both raise and lower terrain.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"107946","CommunityRating":"3.3333333333333335","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doshin_the_Giant","Platform":"Nintendo 64DD","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo"},"LEGO Racers":{"Name":"LEGO Racers","ReleaseDate":"1999-10-22T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"In LEGO Racers, the player assumes the role of either one of several pre-built Lego characters or a custom-built driver.

There are five worlds and each one must be unlocked by finding five cards from the previous world excluding the first.  Each world is divided into five stages with each stage divided into four levels.

How the story plays out in detail depends on which of the seven characters is used in story mode. The selectable characters are the protagonists' mecha from the series Daitarn 3, Dancougar, G Gundam, Dunbine, Xabungle and Voltes V plus the R-1 from Shin Super Robot Taisen. By meeting certain conditions while playing, three more characters can be unlocked, including one that makes its debut in this game.\n\nThe gameplay itself follows the genre standards: both opponents can perform a set of standard and special attacks (the latter executed with certain button combinations). Every hit causes the energy bar to go down and whoever runs out first, loses. When a timer runs out, the one with the most energy left wins. Each fighter also has a second energy meter which can be used to perform especially powerful attacks. The robots also can fly which changes the available attack range. The playing modes are story, vs (two players), 64 (same as story mode without the story), Guts (fighting one opponent after another until the energy runs out), time attack (defeating opponents in a short time) and training.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/zcIUnGhlfts?t=30","DatabaseID":"133117","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Robot_Spirits","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Fighting","Developer":"Banpresto","Publisher":"Banpresto"},"Super Smash Bros.":{"Name":"Super Smash Bros.","ReleaseDate":"1999-01-21T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Super Smash Bros. takes familiar Nintendo characters such as Mario, Kirby and Donkey Kong, and gets them to fight to the death.

Five different gameplay modes, including Arcade, Time Trial, Championship, Finals and Versus Battle were planned for the game.\n\nSome months later, on May 2000, Looking Glass Studios went out of business during a financial crisis related to their publisher at the time, Eidos Interactive. Wildwaters / Extreme Kayak vanished forever, along with their other promising N64 racing game, Mini Racers.\n\nThere was another cancelled water racing game titled “Wild Water World Championships” that was planned for the Nintendo 64, but it should not be confused with this one as WWWC was developed by Promethean Designs.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"95725","CommunityRating":"5","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Developer":"Looking Glass Studios"},"Wipeout 64":{"Name":"Wipeout 64","ReleaseDate":"1998-11-03T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"WipEout 64 was released by Psygnosis as a follow-up to the racing game WipEout XL, taking place one year later in 2098.
