While sharing themes and gameplay elements from its main counterpart, Ristar, for the Sega Genesis, it is a largely different game. The game was well received by critics, who felt the gameplay mechanics were transferred over well to the older, aging Game Gear system, but were divided on whether or not the game was worth playing if both versions of the game were available to the consumer. The game received even less exposure than its Genesis counterpart, due to the Game Gear being towards the end of its lifecycle, and having less of a userbase to begin with in comparison to the Genesis.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFaHmJatCEg","DatabaseID":"24374","CommunityRating":"5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ristar","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Biox","Publisher":"Sega"},"Road Rash":{"Name":"Road Rash","ReleaseDate":"1994-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Road Rash is the name of a motorcycle-racing video game series by Electronic Arts in which the player participates in violent, illegal street races. The series started on the Mega Drive and made its way to various other systems over the years. The game's title is based on the slang term for the severe friction burns that can occur in a motorcycle fall where skin comes into contact with the ground at high speed.\n\nIn an attempt to improve on the basic Hang-On concept, where the player's vehicle remains on the same horizontal plane and turns are essentially a matter of moving left or right, Road Rash requires that players contend with various grade changes. The physics reflect the act of going up or down a hill, as well as turning while climbing; this results in the ability to launch one's motorcycle great distances, resulting in crashes (and their animations). Aside from this, Road Rash has a standard system of obstacles including street signs, trees, poles, and livestock; and taking from OutRun, active traffic while racing against other bikers.\n\nWhat Road Rash really brings to the table is \"brawling\"; the player can fight other bikers with a variety of hand weapons or simple punches and kicks. The player initially starts off with just those basics, but can grab a weapon from another rider by timing a punch correctly. The list of weapons has grown with the games, starting from the clubs in the first Road Rash, and eventually including things like crowbars, nunchaku, and cattle prods. Whatever the weapon, successful attacks damage an opponent's stamina, and depleting this stamina will cause a biker to wipeout which can also damage the bike; this functions much like hitting a car or other major obstacle, and it all applies to you as much as to other racers (though in most of the games, you have more stamina than opponents).\n\nAs mentioned before, the last and most major obstacle are cops. The motorcycle police officers fight the player as another opponent and serve as gameplay enforcers by culling players who fall too far behind or choose to explore the world rather than race in it. Losing a fight with an officer or being caught by one while off one's motorcycle causes the player to be Busted, ending the race.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt9uGfb2uRI","DatabaseID":"19992","CommunityRating":"4.25","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rash_(video_game)","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Action; Racing","Developer":"Probe","Publisher":"U.S. Gold"},"Robocop 3":{"Name":"RoboCop 3","ReleaseDate":"1993-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Old Detroit.

The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.\n\nOn away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.\n\nFinally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.\n\nThe second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"25222","CommunityRating":"5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Generations:_Beyond_the_Nexus","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Developer":"Absolute Entertainment","Publisher":"Absolute Entertainment"},"Star Trek TNG - Advanced Holodeck Tutorial":{"Name":"Star Trek: The Next Generation: Advanced Holodeck Tutorial","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"In Star Trek: TNG - AHT, the player will partake in a holodeck simulation on the U.S.S.

For 1993 the list is quite out of date; the Federal Republic of Germany (more commonly known as West Germany) had not existed since 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russia is represented with the flag of the Soviet Union which dissolved in late 1991, and Yugoslavia had ceased to exist by mid-1992.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur9Dykrz9NE","DatabaseID":"25341","CommunityRating":"5","WikipediaURL":"https://segaretro.org/Kick_%26_Rush","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"SIMS","Publisher":"Tengen"},"World Cup USA 94":{"Name":"World Cup USA 94","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Realistic gameplay with over 15 different moves.

However, after completing a level, the player has to choose a new character he hasn't used yet for the next stage. If a character looses all his health, he has to fill it up with the health of the other characters and thus weakening them for the later levels.

Nanakyou no Tatakai":{"Name":"Yuu Yuu Hakusho II: Gekitou! Nanakyou no Tatakai","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"While the first game was a side-scrolling beat 'em up featuring four characters from the manga, the second game is a one-on-one fighting game. The game though does take a different approach than games like Street Fighter, as you do not control the movement of your character, as both opponents stand still. You fight by pressing a combination of buttons to make your character perform a certain attack. The efficiency of the attack depends on two factors: The position of a moving cross-hair on the body of your opponent, which determines the spot you attack, and the amount of energy in a displayed \"move gauge\" which increases over the time. To perform a special attack, you also need a certain amount of Ki energy which is displayed in another gauge. The Ki regenerates while it's not used further, and without Ki a player is limited to only normal attacks. The triggered attacks are then displayed in an anime style animation sequence showing both opponents doing their corresponding move.\n\nIn single player mode (a two-player mode is available via linking two Game Gears), one may either play a tournament or single fight against a character of one' choice. However, not all fighters are accessible from the beginning (the single combat mode also starts with one character less than the tournament mode) and must be unlocked by progressing in the game (progress is saved with passwords). Altogether, there are seven characters to choose from: Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, Itsuki, Toguro and Sensui Shinobu.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"20546","CommunityRating":"5","WikipediaURL":"https://segaretro.org/Yuu_Yuu_Hakusho_II:_Gekitou!_Nanakyou_no_Tatakai","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Minato Giken","Publisher":"Sega"},"Zan Gear":{"Name":"Zan Gear","ReleaseDate":"1990-10-27T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Zan Gear (斬ギア) is a simulation game for the Sega Game Gear.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"20545","CommunityRating":"5","WikipediaURL":"https://segaretro.org/Zan_Gear","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Wolf Team"},"Zool":{"Name":"Zool: Ninja of the \"Nth\" Dimension","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Once every year, the games world is rocked by a game so stunning, so fast, so colorful, so big, so demanding, so mega, so awesome, so varied , so incredible, and so full of fabulous features and unexpected treats, that everybody just looks at it and says \"THAT'S IT!\" This year, ZOOL, THE NINJA FROM THE Nth DIMENSION, is definitely \"IT!\"","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWe2lWv9Duw","DatabaseID":"25345","CommunityRating":"4.333333333333333","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zool","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Gremlin Graphics","Publisher":"GameTek"},"Zoop":{"Name":"Zoop","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Right here inside this little box is the excitement you crave, the challenge you need.
