The player can choose from historically accurate 1988 presidential election candidates George HW Bush (for Republicans) and Michael Dukakis (for Democrats) as well as real-life political figures involved in the 1988 election - Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson. They can also select between a fictional representation of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called \"Sasha\", and \"Suzuki\", a Japanese-American senator from California with a pro-Japan platform presumably intended to appeal to the game's entirely Japanese audience.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player has four different issues to take either a liberal, conservative, or centrist position on. The player must make wise use of his funds as he is trying to become the President of the United States of America. Being liberal offends the religious folks, being conservative offends the university students and working class voters, and being centrist (as in pleasing everybody) actually pleases nobody. The player starts in February 1988 at a convention for his political party somewhere in the Midwestern United States. and must work his way up to the final election results on November 1988 without becoming bankrupt.\n\nIn the presently unknown primary election, candidates in five states (including players) make the final selection along with the decision-making. Opinion polls and election campaigns (speeches) do benefit the player in his presidential campaign. However, the primary elections in are not implemented in all states in the same way. Some states may be processed automatically by computer (a fixed number of delegate count) while others in a more manual way. The Super Tuesday primaries are to be held on the same day in many states, ballot counting is done after the player has made simultaneous attempts in each campaign state into three regions. After that, the primary election is made (not counting district units held, subject to the provisions of the delegate count.)\n\nThe priorities of the policies that the player can make were introduced to the game as the situation was in 1988 because of the Soviet Union and the CoCom. In 1991, the dissolution of the Soviet Union would eventually lead to CoCom being disbanded in 1994. South Africa had an apartheid at the time and abolished in it 1991. The Panama Canal Zone was returned in 1999 to the people of Panama. However, it differs from the political situation encountered in the game. The \"AIDS patient isolation\" issue was showing an event of discriminatory policy of an era that had not shown wide public awareness about how the AIDS virus manages to spread from person to person.\n\nIf the player manages to win the game and become President of the United States, the official Presidential Oath is displayed in English.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHMU3qcGooE","DatabaseID":"26388","CommunityRating":"1","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Dait%C5%8Dry%C5%8D_Senkyo","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"Hect","Publisher":"Hect"},"American Dream":{"Name":"American Dream","ReleaseDate":"1989-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The player must earn money in order to become the wealthiest gambler in the world.

However, a black limousine that escorts the player from the air force base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos.\n\nThe player starts out in the poorest district of Brooklyn and must work through the boroughs of New York City outside Manhattan, including Queens or The Bronx, in order to amass wealth. With luck and finesse, the player can ultimately break the bank in New Jersey. To enter a casino, the player must find a permit (which serves as photo identification for the casinos) somewhere in Brooklyn. Slot machines come in denominations from $1–$100000 depending on the neighborhood and the presence of a VIP card. Three types of slot machines can be played at each level and the player is photographed when winning the jackpot.\n\nPlayers must be wary of dice games that have dangerous risks in addition to card games - they randomly appear like monster battles in traditional role-playing games. Many buildings including airports, police stations, and casinos either help or hinder the player's attempts to earn enough money on the slot machines for passage to the wealthier district. Guns (in the form of a pistol) can be found that can protect the player against muggers. However, the police will confiscate the weapon from this player once he arrives at a certain area in Manhattan.

The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.\n\nThe game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a \"wing\") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.\n\nCompleting the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely. If the player gains over 10,000,000 points in this way before completing the final level, the counter takes over 20 minutes to increase to 99,999,999 points.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"21127","CommunityRating":"3.25","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"8","Genres":"Shooter","Developer":"Data East","Publisher":"Data East"},"Babel no Tou":{"Name":"Babel no Tou","ReleaseDate":"1986-07-18T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"In the beginning, an archaeologist and explorer known as Indiana Borgnine, is in search of the fabled Hanging Gardens of Babylon. After reading some lost scriptures, he determines that the only way to see them is to travel to the very top of the 64-story Tower of Babel. Upon reaching the Tower, he discovers that the only way to access the floors above him are to solve some challenging puzzles involving loose L-shaped blocks that he finds throughout the Tower. To his great surprise, the blocks are capable of balancing very well on top of one another, in order to form staircases.\n\nThe player controls Indiana Borgnine through 64 levels, using L-shaped blocks and vines in order to reach the exit of each level. On some levels, the exit is blocked by a mask, and there are crystal balls throughout the level. If all of the crystal balls on a level are collected, then the mask covering that level's exit will disappear, and the exit will no longer be blocked.

Each side is represented by a craft called a \"rotofoil\", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled \"droid\" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.\n\nA player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it, at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button, and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball, his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball, while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent's goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield, and as goals are scored, the goal becomes narrower.\n\nPushing the ball through the goal scores one point, firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points, and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten, meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent's score to be reduced by the same amount, resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out. If time runs out and the score is tied, the game goes into \"sudden death\", where the first player to score wins.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26454","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Publisher":"Pony Canyon"},"Balloon Fight":{"Name":"Balloon Fight","ReleaseDate":"1985-01-22T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"You'll need lightning-fast reactions to win this battle in the sky!\n\nTake to the skies!

A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year.  Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992.  Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form.  Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players.  Enhanced pitch control.  Ability to shift field formations when playing defense.  Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game.  Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired.  Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.)  Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting.  Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each.  New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation.  Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams.  You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5.  Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum.  You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name.  Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves.

It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game.  In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red.  The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible.  The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race.

An option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings.  Nintendo Power gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while Electronic Gaming Monthly issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.  Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate.  In addition to those options, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments.  The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.  However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited.  Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's \"Kenrip\" being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken).  There is even a cheat code that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"7822","CommunityRating":"2.875","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"8","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Beam Software","Publisher":"Data East"},"Bokosuka Wars":{"Name":"Bokosuka Wars","ReleaseDate":"1985-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"This game revolves around a leader who must lead an army in phalanx formation across a battlefield in real-time against overwhelming enemy forces while freeing and recruiting soldiers along the way, with each unit able to gain experience and level up through battle.

The game has also variously been described as an early example of an action role-playing game, an early prototype real-time strategy game, and a unique reverse tower defense game.

The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)\nPower-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.\nTwo players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.\nThe arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1660","CommunityRating":"3.0263157894736841","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"19","Genres":"Shooter","Developer":"Zippo Games","Publisher":"Milton Bradley Company"},"Cadillac":{"Name":"Cadillac","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-02T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Cadillac is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Hect, which was released in Japan in 1990.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26580","CommunityRating":"2","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"Hect","Publisher":"Hect"},"Caesars Palace":{"Name":"Caesars Palace","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"This game allows you to play in the Caesars Palace casino.

The player does not actually earn bonus points for catching the balloon, but he is awarded the normal 'step value' for each of the eight floors that he passes while holding the balloon.\n\nIf the climber is able to ascend to the top of a skyscraper and grabs the runner of a waiting helicopter, he earns a bonus and is transported to another skyscraper, which presents more dangers than the past. The helicopter would only wait about 30 seconds, then fly off.\n\nIf the player completes all four skyscrapers, he is taken back to the first skyscraper and the game restarts from the beginning, but the player keeps his score.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26595","CommunityRating":"2.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Nihon Bussan","Publisher":"Nichibutsu"},"Creatom":{"Name":"Creatom","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Difficult puzzle in which we have to copy the forms we see.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQHEI-rMlx0","DatabaseID":"119072","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Micro Genius","Publisher":"Gluk Video"},"Crime Busters":{"Name":"Crime Busters","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Crime Busters is a light gun game in which the players takes the role of a police officer and has to shoot bandits.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.\nThe standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.\nThe standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.\nCyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1684","CommunityRating":"1.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Atari Games","Publisher":"Atari Games"},"Daisenryaku":{"Name":"Daisenryaku","ReleaseDate":"1988-10-12T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Daisenryaku is a Strategy game, developed by Quest and published by Bothtec, which was released in Japan in 1988.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26611","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"Quest","Publisher":"Bothtec"},"Dance Aerobics":{"Name":"Dance Aerobics","ReleaseDate":"1987-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"It's time to get up and get physical with Nintendo's DANCE AEROBICS.

Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit.

Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain.

In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the \"foot meter\". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1695","CommunityRating":"2.8333333333333335","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"6","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Pack-In-Video","Publisher":"Activision"},"Dig Dug":{"Name":"Dig Dug","ReleaseDate":"1985-06-04T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Dig a little deeper into this thrilling action game as Dig Dug!

The objective is to bring peace to his magical land by controlling the famous fast food clown. Most of Ronald's companions have been kidnapped, and the animals have turned feral. His brainwashed companions will occasionally attack. Ronald can defend himself using apple bombs, thrown in a carefully calculated parabola.Being hit by the enemy causes damage, which decreases Ronald's \"Life\" meter. During various parts of a stage, players have the opportunity to collect up to 100 hamburger icons throughout the game. This will result in gaining a bonus life along with the hamburger counter resetting itself to zero. It is also possible to play a mini-game challenge, to earn commodities that the player orders from McDonald's.\n\nRonald can replenish his life bar by finding heart icons that are scattered throughout the level; the maximum number of hits that he can withstand before dying is five.

An enemy appears in the second level that resembles Little Red Riding Hood; although she causes damage like a normal enemy and cannot be destroyed by the player's apple bombs.

The first World is an action game that takes place in a city that scrolls continuously in four directions.

Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three – the obstacle course – featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller's D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman's Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, \"Dallas\", Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. \"Prizes\" for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best \"ending\" by completing the last obstacle. The obstacle course's flag colour depended on which team was playing, if blue, the flags were blue, and if red, the flags were red.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1698","CommunityRating":"3.2857142857142856","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Rare","Publisher":"GameTek"},"Double Dragon":{"Name":"Double Dragon","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers who learned to fight on the cold, tough streets of the city.

Under the monk's care, Clovis began to learn various aspects of knowledge, including how to be a superior swordsman. When word reached the monk that King Lawrence's 16-year-old daughter Celia had been abducted and held by a fearsome dragon, who wished to break the kingdom's spirit and coerce the kingdom to do his bidding, Clovis felt a sense of duty to chase after the dragon and rescue Celia in the name of his father. In order to save his sister, he trained daily with the monk and learned to withstand injury, whether cut by swords or burned by flame, and still be just as capable a fighter as ever.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26778","CommunityRating":"2.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Namco"},"Dragon Fighter":{"Name":"Dragon Fighter","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"An unlicensed fighting game for the Famicom which pits characters from several fighting game franchises against one another for the ultimate street combat experience.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba-aT2s6SlY","DatabaseID":"153173","WikipediaURL":"http://bootleggames.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Fighter","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Fighting","Developer":"Flying Star","Publisher":"Flying Star"},"Dragon Power":{"Name":"Dragon Power","ReleaseDate":"1988-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Dragon Power is an action-adventure game developed and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on March 3, 1988.

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.\nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.\nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.\nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1700","CommunityRating":"4.2894736842105265","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_III","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"19","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Chunsoft","Publisher":"Enix"},"Dragon Warrior IV":{"Name":"Dragon Warrior IV","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-11T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Dragon Warrior IV differs from the rest of the series by breaking up the game into five distinct chapters, each of which focuses on a different protagonist or protagonists.

With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses.

However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.\n\n\"Elysion\" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26785","CommunityRating":"0.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"System Soft","Publisher":"Tokyo Shoseki"},"Emoyan no 10 Bai Pro Yakyuu":{"Name":"Emoyan no 10 Bai Pro Yakyuu","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-19T00:00:00-08:00","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"127663","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Hect","Publisher":"Hect"},"Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken":{"Name":"Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken","ReleaseDate":"1988-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Erika to Satoru no Yume Bōken (えりかとさとるの夢冒険? lit. \"Erika and Satoru's Dream Adventure\") is a 1988 Japan-exclusive adventure video game for the Famicom. It is a fairytale-inspired menu-driven adventure game. Players use the menu commands to interact with the world: moving around, looking around, picking up objects, talking to people, etc. The setting of this game is 20th century Japan.\n\nIn a novel twist, the two characters of Erika and Satoru (who are depicted as twin schoolchildren) are independently playable - either a single player switches between the two, or a second player takes over the second twin. Both characters need to be in the same region to converse with NPCs, but are otherwise free to explore the map autonomously. Two-player adventure games are very rare; even in Japan. However, only one person can partake in the animal quiz portion. Failing the quiz will force the player(s) to start from the beginning.\n\nAn odd bit of infamy related to this game is a secret developer's message that can be found if the player inputs a list of button presses after waiting some time after the game ends. Inside of which is a litany of compliments and complaints to other co-workers, including some sexual insults which are deeply at odds with the child-friendly nature of the game.

Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.\nOnce a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.\nIf a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of \"Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today\".

The goal of each stage is to put out all the fires. The fires are extinguished by either kicking an ice block into the flame, or dropping one from above. Dana's moveset includes the abilities to walk left and right across level ground. He can also climb on top of a solid block to his left or right, provided it is only one block tall and there is nothing on top of it. Dana can also push blocks of ice, which will then slide until they fall or hit a wall. Dana's most important ability is his ice magic. He can create and destroy blocks of ice. As the gameplay is grid-based, Dana's ice magic affects the squares beneath him and to the left and right, similar to Lode Runner. If the ice block is placed horizontally adjacent to a wall, pipe, jar, or another ice block, it will freeze to the adjacent surface.\n\nThere are also other elements that are introduced as the player progresses, including pipes (which Dana can travel through) and jars. Dana can walk across normal jars, but once a jar comes in contact with a flame, it begins to burn. Dana cannot walk across the top of burning jars, and any ice that is created in, or enters the square above a burning jar is destroyed. As players progress, the puzzles get more complicated and difficult. The simple gameplay must be used in new ways by players who wish to complete the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll6cMyWnHN4","DatabaseID":"20097","CommunityRating":"3.9375","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%27n_Ice","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"16","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Tecmo","Publisher":"Tecmo"},"Fire Dragon":{"Name":"Fire Dragon","Overview":"Fire Dragon is a Snake clone developed by Gamtec.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"133592","CommunityRating":"2","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"11","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Gamtec","Publisher":"BIC"},"Fire Emblem Gaiden":{"Name":"Fire Emblem Gaiden","ReleaseDate":"1992-03-14T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Follow Alm and Celica on their adventures through the kingdoms of Rigel and Zofia in this side story to the original Fire Emblem!

Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nA couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the \"Turbo File,\" which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well.

Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan-no Sho, or book of the mind's eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan's last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji.

As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses.

One day, Tippy has inflated a whole bunch of balloons when suddenly a strong wind blows. Tippy is blown away! The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.\n\nHello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid – a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.\n\nThroughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airborne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water. Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight, these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"25402","CommunityRating":"4.1428571428571432","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_Kid#Ports_and_related_releases","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Pax Softonica","Publisher":"Character Soft"},"Hello Kitty no Ohanabatake":{"Name":"Hello Kitty no Ohanabatake","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-11T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"During the course of this video game, Hello Kitty must water all the flowers in each stage while avoiding the many animals and insects.

I found this name to be pretty strange, but once I started understanding what this game was all about, it made sense. It was released December 15, 1990 exclusively in Japan for the Famicom. It turns out Hissatsu Shigotonin is actually biased off of the popular Japanese historical drama TV series of the same name. The story of both focus on a group of ordinary \"work people\" who live double lives as assassins. It is an alternate Feudal Japan history (1603-1863) featuring fictional characters with elements of a parallel world. You must uncover a mystery though out the game, which comes though the story in episodes like the TV show. The player controls Nakamura Mondo, a fictional character who is also the star of the TV show. The game is biased on the original 84 episode run/first season of the TV series from 1979-1981 but features characters all the way up to the game’s release date. The show continues to this day with Assassins as a subtitle. This seems like a really cool concept for a weekly episodic series. The story has an almost assassins creed feel. I’m sure the idea of everyday people turned into warriors has been around in stories forever, but the setting and time period makes it stand out. Japan’s feudal era is one of the most intense of all the time periods in earth’s history. It was a time of Samurai, Ninja and technology that eventually killed off said Samurai and Ninja. One of the biggest draws of the era is the is the fantastic culture that knew of the outside world, but worked hard in maintaining isolation making them truly unique. The main character, Nakamura Mondo, is a corrupt cop known for accepting bribes who is disrespected by his superiors, and mother-in-law. He ends up bringing together a group of people that have all been wronged in some way, formed to solve mysteries and assassinate targets. The heroes play by the same rules as the villains, as they are not afraid to use underhanded tactics to get the job done. Each episode of the show usually climaxes with the killing of the target, sometimes in an almost humorous manner such as a flower through the skull. I was able to find a random episode but no dubs or subs, which is a bummer since I wanted to learn more of the story. It seems to hold up well to time, has a campy feel to it and comes off like a live action anime. Check out this trailer for one of their many movies to get a better idea of the style, think Al Bundy the Samuri and his gang of misfits.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L9JvS2VpuI","DatabaseID":"133598","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Arc System Works Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Banpresto Co., Ltd."},"Hit Marmot":{"Name":"Hit Marmot","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Hit Marmot is another concoction by Mega Soft, which makes use of the Zapper peripheral.

The scene is the town's main street, with a view from behind the Sheriff's back (the view is so close that only the Sheriff's waist, right arm and gun are visible). Various other characters appear on the main street in front of the Sheriff.\n\nThe actual gameplay mostly concerns the Sheriff discussing with the various characters via a selection menu similar to those in contemporary graphical adventures. For each line the other character says, the game offers a selection of four different responses, and the discussion progresses depending on the chosen response. Law of the West marks the first use of this now-common interaction style.\n\nAs well as the discussion, the Sheriff occasionally gets involved in gunfights. In this case, the gameplay becomes a pure test of shooting skills, as the Sheriff has to shoot his opponent before getting shot himself. Gunplay is accomplished by pushing up on the joystick to draw the weapon, which causes a joystick-controlled crosshairs to appear on the screen. The various characters would react if the Sheriff drew his gun before they had a chance to say their opening line, usually refusing to speak until the gun was put away.\n\nIf the Sheriff gets shot, he blacks out, and the doctor is called to help. Depending on the Sheriff's previous interaction with the doctor and the other characters in the game (and if the doctor's in town), he may either be healed, or left for dead (either by the doctor refusing to help, or the doctor being drunk at the time). The only goal of the game is for the player to make it alive to the end of the day; if the player wishes he can gun down every character he meets without talking to them albeit this will be reflected negatively in the final score.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27174","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Pony Canyon"},"Layla":{"Name":"Layla","ReleaseDate":"1986-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Layla has to rescue her friend Iris from a genetically modified apparatus named Jill; who is apparently controlled by a Dr. Manitoka.

Each asteroid is divided into two sections; the first part involving the surface of the asteroid while the second part deals with the actual enemy base.\n\nThere is an equally large mechanical element to the level as there is a biological element. The screen always scrolls from left to right. No backtracking is permitted on any level.

The handgun is the player's initial weapon; but more powerful weapons can be found just by exploring.

Later rounds also feature Jumbo Tires that bounce towards the Runner, Walls that emerge from the ground before receding back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto the Runner and slow him down, and Chess Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another.\n\nThe rounds also feature Springboards, which can be used to propel the Runner forward at a great speed. Some rounds have a special layout of Springboards, where it is possible to use one Springboard to land directly on the second one. Some other rounds also feature Skateboards which will speed the Runner up and make him immune to Slip Zones. There are also two different types of drink cans; kicking them will either gain the player bonus points (from 100 to 5000) or speed the Runner up, but jumping on them will stop the timer for a few seconds.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27202","CommunityRating":"2.75","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"Now Production","Publisher":"Namco"},"Metroid":{"Name":"Metroid","ReleaseDate":"1986-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"You’re inside the fortress planet Zebes.

The dogs want to kill Milky before she can rescue her son Michael who wandered out into the city on his own (and became lost). Players must catch the fish for temporary invincibility. However, the other enemies can still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the pylons. The city is divided into roads for automobile traffic and sidewalks for roaming pedestrian dogs in overalls. The fish merchants completely replace the dogs after the 30th level; causing the invincibility icon (fish) to become redundant.\n\nUnlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of video games (especially the first NES release which would come out four years later in 1989), open manholes kill the player instead of helping her evade the roaming dogs. Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player. The game was targeted to a much younger audience than was considered to be \"average\" in the Nintendo Entertainment System community during that era. Using the classical music song Ballet des poussins dans leurs coques (composed by Modest Mussorgsky) as the background music, there is a common theme throughout the game of \"dog catches cat; cat catches fish\" - emulating the food chain.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27241","CommunityRating":"2.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Micronics","Publisher":"Pony Canyon"},"Operation Secret Storm":{"Name":"Operation Secret Storm","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-21T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"After a briefing of the Gulf War situation, Agent George, a Top CIA agent, is being sent to the Middle East.

Most cancelled games saw months' worth of publicity in video game magazines before fading off the game-watch radars. The gameplay is very similar to Sunsoft's Batman games, Batman and Batman: Return of the Joker, in that the character can run, jump, punch and duck, although in this game the player can also fly simply by pushing up. There are also some side scrolling flying levels where you can shoot laser/heat vision from your eyes. The game is divided into five scenes with one-four areas with a boss at the end of each area.\n\nThe game features a superhero, named Sunman. He is very reminiscent of Superman with his cape, and flying abilities, as well as the games title screen seems to match that of the Superman logo. Sunsoft's involvement with other DC Comics character licenses lead some to speculate that Sunman was intended to be a Superman game, but DC for whatever reason decided not to go along and the game had some changes made to lose the likeness. In an interview with planner/director Kenji Eno, it was confirmed that this was originally intended to be a Superman game.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"22455","CommunityRating":"4.333333333333333","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Action","Developer":"EIM"},"Super Arabian":{"Name":"Super Arabian","ReleaseDate":"1985-07-25T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"An action platformer styled as an Arabian Nights-flavored \"storybook\", which follows the trials of a brave Arabian prince as he attempts to infiltrate the palace and save a princess locked in the tower.

This comparison is also true for the sport of badminton itself, which has a similar focus on performing hard-to-counter spike attacks close to the net in order to score points.

After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.\n\nThis title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.\n\nTo further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27302","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Pax Softonica","Publisher":"Vap"},"Super Rugby":{"Name":"Super Rugby","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-27T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Super Rugby is a Sports game, developed by Zap and published by TSS, which was released in Japan in 1989.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27289","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Zap","Publisher":"TSS"},"Super Spike V'Ball":{"Name":"Super Spike V'Ball","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Warm up with a few exercise games then face contenders in the American Circuit.

The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.\n\nAll of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a \"tetris\". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation.

There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.\n\nTetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.\n\nBomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.\n\nBomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"115796","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Chunsoft","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software"},"Tetsuwan Atom":{"Name":"Tetsuwan Atom","ReleaseDate":"1988-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Tetsuwan Atom (鉄腕アトム?) is an action game developed by Home Data and published by Konami for the Famicom in Japan early on in 1988.

The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.\n\nOnce the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ?) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク?) mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the \"neutral gangs.\" These \"neutral gangs\" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying \"no\" when asked to fight (たたかい?, \"Struggle\").\n\nNeutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game.\n\nThat means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either move (いどうし?, \"Not among\") his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn. It is possible for a player to transfer all of his gang members out of a territory, turning it into a blank grey territory without a number.","MaxPlayers":"3","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27327","CommunityRating":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Sammy Studios","Publisher":"Sammy Studios"},"Twin Cobra":{"Name":"Twin Cobra","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"You pilot the TC-17 Twin Cobra assault helicopter to fight the forces of Commander Anziga, the myopic leader of the nation of Kaban.

All the animals were docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Taros, and other races mingled with one another and worked to make Marvel Land into an increasingly beautiful place to live. A large clock tower resembling a stone grandfather clock stood watch over the countryside of Marvel Land. Long ago, an ancient evil had been sealed within the clock tower. The people needn't fret, however. For those days had long since passed, or so they had thought.\n\nThe Key of Time that rested in the center of the face of the clock tower had long since been used to seal away the ancient evil that lies within. Until one day, the clock tower mysteriously stopped working. In an effort to rewind the clock, a villager takes it upon himself to do just that. Fumbling with the key, the villager drops the Key of Time, foolishly. In a frantic manner, the villager picks up the key and tries to reset it back into place before a catastrophe befalls Marvel Land. But then, it was too late for the villager to accomplish the task. The ancient evil of legend, Zouna, the dark wizard who manipulates time itself was unleashed upon the world once more. And to prevent anyone else from sealing him away once again, Zouna takes the Key of Time for himself.\n\nFinally freed after many years, Zouna wastes no time in wreaking havoc and chaos over Marvel Land. Zouna unleashes his manifested darkness over the land, and lays waste to the countryside. Feeling confident in his reign, Zouna constructs his castle in which to preside over Marvel Land from. The peaceful inhabitants of Marvel Land cried out in terror as Zouna's manifested darkness came after them one by one. Zouna's darkness corrupted the hearts of anyone it came across, and possessed them against their wills. Once thriving towns and villages fell into ruination. Family members were parted from their loved ones. Only a few scattered towns remained standing; forming a last bastion in resistance to Zouna's dark invasion. A futile effort. Even Kurino Sandra would come to meet his heroic demise, subdued by Zouna's power. Marvel Land is in dire need of a savior.\n\nThe desperate call has been answered by the heavens. The child of the gods, Valkyrie, a fledgling maiden descends to Marvel Land from heaven. Her first adventure, she wields a simple shield and a short sword (a mace of light in the remake), vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness that has consumed it. Then her adventure to defeat the evil Zouna begins.\n\nThe game has a scrolling overworld like Dragon Warrior/Quest, with a real-time combat system similar to The Legend of Zelda. The player controls Valkyrie in her quest to defeat Zouna and restore peace to Marvel Land. With brown hair and no helmet, she begins the game armed with only a short sword. The player helps Valkyrie fight monsters, collect gold and find stronger equipment which will increase her powers; eventually, she finds a helmet and cloak. With the people of Marvel Land terrorized or controlled by Zouna, she receives no hints or advice. The player must devise a plan to defeat Zouna, with many of Valkyrie's tasks not immediately apparent; some can only be guessed by exploration and experimentation.\n\nWhen Valkyrie defeats a monster, she earns experience points towards the next level and (usually) a small amount of money. Although money is scarce in Marvel Land, the player rarely needs it to buy equipment. All the game's items can be obtained for free if the player knows where to look. In addition to equipping weapons and armor, Valkyrie gains access to seven spells. When she learns each one depends on her intelligence, which increases with each level of experience. The first, and possibly the most valuable, of these is the healing spell.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eLuLJ5sFK8","DatabaseID":"97351","CommunityRating":"2.5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie_no_B%C5%8Dken:_Toki_no_Kagi_Densetsu","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco"},"Vegas Dream":{"Name":"Vegas Dream","ReleaseDate":"1990-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Bring a casino to your living room!

Players can either accelerate or hit the brakes on their motorcycle so they can avoid getting into an accident. Accidents cause the player to lose fuel and running out of fuel can end the game. So players must keep an eye out on the fuel gauge, which can be refilled by fuel barrels littered throughout each stage. Each car the player passes betters their ranks which increases their score.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgsTZ12VlDM","DatabaseID":"26405","CommunityRating":"4.333333333333333","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MotoRace_USA","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"Irem","Publisher":"Irem"},"Zombie Hunter":{"Name":"Zombie Hunter","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-03T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Zombie Hunter is a Role-Playing game, developed by Lenar and published by Hi-Score Media Work, which was released in Japan in 1987.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"25487","CommunityRating":"0.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Lenar","Publisher":"Hi-Score Media Work"},"Zombie Nation":{"Name":"Zombie Nation","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"1999. What appeared to be a harmless meteorite crashing in the Nevada desert has turned out to be Darc Seed, an evil alien creature with horrible powers. By shooting strange magnetic rays, Darc Seed had turned the helpless nation into zombies and had brought the Statue of Liberty to life to do his dirty work. These rays had also given him control over many deadly weapons, but none were more powerful than the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi, heard that the sword had fallen into evil hands, he set off immediately for the United States. For only he possessed the strength and knowledge needed to recapture the magical sword and free the U.S. from the evil clutches of Darc Seed.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"2058","CommunityRating":"3.4285714285714284","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_Nation_(video_game)","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"14","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Developer":"KaZe","Publisher":"Meldac of America"},"Zunou Senkan Galg":{"Name":"Zunou Senkan Galg","ReleaseDate":"1985-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Zunou Senkan Galg (\"Brain Battleship Galg\"), referred to as just Galg by the game's title screen, is a vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player must navigate a serious of canyon-like environments for missing pieces to a war machine. Each stage has at least one piece, so the player must visit them all in order to find the necessary number. In addition to this, there are numerous secrets hidden throughout the many stages of the game, and the player frequently has to choose between multiple paths which lead to different stages. The game advertises itself as a \"RPG\" on its box art, referring to this additional layer of complexity.\n\nLike The Tower of Druaga, it is considered a historically important game in Japan for the amount of secrets and mysteries it contains and the subsequent difficulty involved in reaching the end without this hidden knowledge. Therefore, it was one of the earliest games for the Famicom to feature its own printed game guide for players to follow. Zunou Senkan Galg is almost entirely unheard of outside of Japan, however, and has never seen a release outside of its native country.\n\nThough it was published by dB-Soft, the game was developed by a group named \"Team Bioteckers\". Galg is their only known video game credit.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26884","CommunityRating":"2.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Shooter","Developer":"Team Bioteckers","Publisher":"dB-Soft"}}
