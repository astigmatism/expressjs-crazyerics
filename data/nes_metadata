The player can choose from historically accurate 1988 presidential election candidates George HW Bush (for Republicans) and Michael Dukakis (for Democrats) as well as real-life political figures involved in the 1988 election - Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson. They can also select between a fictional representation of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called \"Sasha\", and \"Suzuki\", a Japanese-American senator from California with a pro-Japan platform presumably intended to appeal to the game's entirely Japanese audience.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player has four different issues to take either a liberal, conservative, or centrist position on. The player must make wise use of his funds as he is trying to become the President of the United States of America. Being liberal offends the religious folks, being conservative offends the university students and working class voters, and being centrist (as in pleasing everybody) actually pleases nobody. The player starts in February 1988 at a convention for his political party somewhere in the Midwestern United States. and must work his way up to the final election results on November 1988 without becoming bankrupt.\n\nIn the presently unknown primary election, candidates in five states (including players) make the final selection along with the decision-making. Opinion polls and election campaigns (speeches) do benefit the player in his presidential campaign. However, the primary elections in are not implemented in all states in the same way. Some states may be processed automatically by computer (a fixed number of delegate count) while others in a more manual way. The Super Tuesday primaries are to be held on the same day in many states, ballot counting is done after the player has made simultaneous attempts in each campaign state into three regions. After that, the primary election is made (not counting district units held, subject to the provisions of the delegate count.)\n\nThe priorities of the policies that the player can make were introduced to the game as the situation was in 1988 because of the Soviet Union and the CoCom. In 1991, the dissolution of the Soviet Union would eventually lead to CoCom being disbanded in 1994. South Africa had an apartheid at the time and abolished in it 1991. The Panama Canal Zone was returned in 1999 to the people of Panama. However, it differs from the political situation encountered in the game. The \"AIDS patient isolation\" issue was showing an event of discriminatory policy of an era that had not shown wide public awareness about how the AIDS virus manages to spread from person to person.\n\nIf the player manages to win the game and become President of the United States, the official Presidential Oath is displayed in English.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHMU3qcGooE","DatabaseID":"26388","CommunityRating":"1","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Dait%C5%8Dry%C5%8D_Senkyo","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"Hect","Publisher":"Hect"},"America Oudan Ultra Quiz - Shijou Saidai no Tatakai":{"Name":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz: Shijou Saidai no Tatakai","ReleaseDate":"1991-11-29T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"This game has two modes: story and tournament.

The game, set in New York City, is considered a spin-off from the Pachio-kun franchise.\n\nRoads, taxis and automobiles are not portrayed in the game. However, a black limousine that escorts the player from the air force base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos.\n\nThe player starts out in the poorest district of Brooklyn and must work through the boroughs of New York City outside Manhattan, including Queens or The Bronx, in order to amass wealth. With luck and finesse, the player can ultimately break the bank in New Jersey. To enter a casino, the player must find a permit (which serves as photo identification for the casinos) somewhere in Brooklyn. Slot machines come in denominations from $1–$100000 depending on the neighborhood and the presence of a VIP card. Three types of slot machines can be played at each level and the player is photographed when winning the jackpot.\n\nPlayers must be wary of dice games that have dangerous risks in addition to card games - they randomly appear like monster battles in traditional role-playing games. Many buildings including airports, police stations, and casinos either help or hinder the player's attempts to earn enough money on the slot machines for passage to the wealthier district. Guns (in the form of a pistol) can be found that can protect the player against muggers. However, the police will confiscate the weapon from this player once he arrives at a certain area in Manhattan. Pachiko-kun (the player) will also be arrested and will be held unless a $100,000 ($190,899.33 in today's money) bail can be paid in full.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCHAW0eAHEU","DatabaseID":"24827","CommunityRating":"1.125","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream_(video_game)","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"8","Genres":"Role-Playing; Casino","Developer":"Soft Machine","Publisher":"Coconuts"},"American Gladiators":{"Name":"American Gladiators","ReleaseDate":"1991-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"American Gladiators is licensed from the popular TV show of the same name.

You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. \n\nThe twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FblDT544bQ","DatabaseID":"26390","CommunityRating":"2.2222222222222223","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasa_(video_game)","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"9","Genres":"Shooter","Developer":"Bits Laboratory","Publisher":"ASCII"},"Astyanax":{"Name":"Astyanax","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Astyanax is a side-scrolling platform game.

It had a unique feature (for the time) of a bar that grows between attacks; the length of the bar determines how much damage Astyanax will do with his next attack.

The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.\n\nThe game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a \"wing\") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.\n\nCompleting the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely. If the player gains over 10,000,000 points in this way before completing the final level, the counter takes over 20 minutes to increase to 99,999,999 points.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"21127","CommunityRating":"3.25","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"8","Genres":"Shooter","Developer":"Data East","Publisher":"Data East"},"Babel no Tou":{"Name":"Babel no Tou","ReleaseDate":"1986-07-18T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"In the beginning, an archaeologist and explorer known as Indiana Borgnine, is in search of the fabled Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

On some levels, the exit is blocked by a mask, and there are crystal balls throughout the level.

Each side is represented by a craft called a \"rotofoil\", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled \"droid\" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.\n\nA player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it, at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button, and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball, his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball, while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent's goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield, and as goals are scored, the goal becomes narrower.\n\nPushing the ball through the goal scores one point, firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points, and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten, meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent's score to be reduced by the same amount, resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out. If time runs out and the score is tied, the game goes into \"sudden death\", where the first player to score wins.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26454","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Publisher":"Pony Canyon"},"Balloon Fight":{"Name":"Balloon Fight","ReleaseDate":"1985-01-22T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"You'll need lightning-fast reactions to win this battle in the sky!\n\nTake to the skies!

A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year.  Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992.  Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form.  Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players.  Enhanced pitch control.  Ability to shift field formations when playing defense.  Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game.  Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired.  Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.)  Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting.  Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each.  New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation.  Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams.  You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5.  Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum.  You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name.  Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders.

The boy and Blobert must traverse the subways and caves beneath the Earth and gain the necessary items before traveling to Blobolonia and defeating the emperor. They must evade dangerous obstacles like falling rocks, stalactites, and stalagmites, as well as deadly, snake enemies. A Boy and His Blob is not a side-scrolling game, but rather presents the player with a series of single, interconnected screens. Despite being a platform game, the player-controlled boy is limited to simply running left or right. The player cannot jump or swim, and if the boy falls too long of a distance, he will die on impact.\n\nThough the player directly controls the boy, Blobert is controlled by the computer AI. The player must rely on the shapeshifting blob to cross gaps, reach higher platforms, and overcome the obstacles and enemies. Blobert can change into several different tools when the player feeds him flavored jelly beans. A licorice jelly bean, for instance, will change Blobert into a ladder, while an apple jelly bean will turn him into a jack. Whistling at Blobert causes him to change back to his original shape and continue following the boy. The player is encouraged to experiment with the jelly beans and their effects to navigate the puzzling game world. Scattered throughout Earth's caverns are various treasures and diamonds that increase the player's score and can be used to purchase vitamins at a drugstore located within the game world.

The player's character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)\nPower-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.\nTwo players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.\nThe arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1660","CommunityRating":"3.0263157894736841","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"19","Genres":"Shooter","Developer":"Zippo Games","Publisher":"Milton Bradley Company"},"Cadillac":{"Name":"Cadillac","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-02T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Cadillac is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Hect, which was released in Japan in 1990.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26580","CommunityRating":"2","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"Hect","Publisher":"Hect"},"Caesars Palace":{"Name":"Caesars Palace","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"This game allows you to play in the Caesars Palace casino.

The bosses are a sea serpent (as seen on the cover), a giant crab, a giant squid, a red and black version of the sea serpent and a giant shark. The game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series. Powerup pods are collected to move the selector to different powerup items. When the desired powerup is highlighted, the player can select it, after which the menu returns to an unhighlighted state. Menu options are \"Turbo\" (increase the speed of the boat), \"Fire\" (increase the number of bullets the primary gun fires), \"Speed\" (increase speed of shots and rate of fire), \"Missile\" (improves missiles) and \"Force\" (a force field around the boat plus replenished health). The speed boat used for game play starts with a single gun which can be upgraded to a quadruple spread shot. Missiles can also be added to the boat's arsenal and can be upgraded to heat-seekers. Between stages which are not connected by water, the Cobra Class has a helicopter style propeller that extends from the roof of the cabin. However, this flying state of the boat is never used in gameplay. The boat has a 12-point damage bar which can be reduced by contact with obstacles or enemy fire.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1677","CommunityRating":"3.2608695652173911","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"23","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"Rare","Publisher":"Nintendo"},"Cocoron":{"Name":"Cocoron","ReleaseDate":"1991-05-03T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Tapir, an enigmatic blue wizard in spotted pajamas from the Dream World, sends the player on a quest to rescue princess Rua.

The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players.

Should the climber succumb to any one of these dangers, a new climber takes his place at the exact point where he fell; the last major danger is eliminated.\n\nOne ally the climber has is a pink \"Lucky Balloon\"; if he is able to grab it, the climber is transported up 8 stories to a window. The window onto which it drops the climber may be about to close. If the window that the climber is dropped onto is fully closed, the balloon pauses there until the window opens up again. The player does not actually earn bonus points for catching the balloon, but he is awarded the normal 'step value' for each of the eight floors that he passes while holding the balloon.\n\nIf the climber is able to ascend to the top of a skyscraper and grabs the runner of a waiting helicopter, he earns a bonus and is transported to another skyscraper, which presents more dangers than the past. The helicopter would only wait about 30 seconds, then fly off.\n\nIf the player completes all four skyscrapers, he is taken back to the first skyscraper and the game restarts from the beginning, but the player keeps his score.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26595","CommunityRating":"2.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Nihon Bussan","Publisher":"Nichibutsu"},"Creatom":{"Name":"Creatom","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Difficult puzzle in which we have to copy the forms we see.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQHEI-rMlx0","DatabaseID":"119072","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Micro Genius","Publisher":"Gluk Video"},"Crime Busters":{"Name":"Crime Busters","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Crime Busters is a light gun game in which the players takes the role of a police officer and has to shoot bandits.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.\nThe standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.\nThe standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.\nCyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1684","CommunityRating":"1.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Atari Games","Publisher":"Atari Games"},"Cybernoid - The Fighting Machine":{"Name":"Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"In Cybernoid, pirates have raided the storage depots of the Federation and stolen minerals, jewels, ammunition and the latest battle weaponry.

All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26765","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"HummingBirdSoft","Publisher":"Square"},"Deep Dungeon IV - Kuro no Youjutsushi":{"Name":"Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Youjutsushi","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-06T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Yōjutsushi (ディープダンジョンIV 黒の妖術師?, lit.

This game also reverts to the standard practice or randomizing characters' stat growth when gaining an experience level. New to this engine is that the player can eventually learn to summon two monsters to function as a temporary additional party member for a single battle. It also removed the feature that stops random battles when the player is significantly more powerful than the enemies. This isn't as bad as it seems as the maps in this game are also much smaller (whereas the previous games used multi-floor dungeons up to 32x32 tiles, the dungeons in this game are either single floor, or multiple floors that can fit within a single 32x32 map) In this game, the player can accept \"requests\" from the non-player characters.

Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply.

In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the \"foot meter\". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1695","CommunityRating":"2.8333333333333335","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"6","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Pack-In-Video","Publisher":"Activision"},"Dig Dug":{"Name":"Dig Dug","ReleaseDate":"1985-06-04T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Dig a little deeper into this thrilling action game as Dig Dug!

Soon, a demonic invasion of the Earth began. Aided by the lovely Yumiko Shirasagi, a transfer student who seems to be interested in him, Nakajima decides to undo his wrongs and defeat the demons. In order to do that, the young couple will need to learn how to use the program for good purposes, and uncover the truth about their own previous incarnations. \n\nBased on a series of horror novels by the Japanese author Aya Nishitani (the first of which is named Digital Devil Story), Megami Tensei (translated as \"Goddess Reincarnation\") marks the birth of the eponymous role-playing franchise.

Communications with randomly encountered demons usually involve offering them money or magnetite (energy they consume); the outcome of the communication depends on the demon's race, alignment, and the phase of the moon.

For example, players had to search outside Ronald's clubhouse for four of the puzzle cards to allow them access to the next level while the Donald Land video game simply consists of defeating enemies while avoiding damage.\n\nThe game stars Ronald McDonald (known in Japan as Donald McDonald), the mascot of the McDonald's fast food chain. The objective is to bring peace to his magical land by controlling the famous fast food clown. Most of Ronald's companions have been kidnapped, and the animals have turned feral. His brainwashed companions will occasionally attack. Ronald can defend himself using apple bombs, thrown in a carefully calculated parabola.Being hit by the enemy causes damage, which decreases Ronald's \"Life\" meter. During various parts of a stage, players have the opportunity to collect up to 100 hamburger icons throughout the game. This will result in gaining a bonus life along with the hamburger counter resetting itself to zero. It is also possible to play a mini-game challenge, to earn commodities that the player orders from McDonald's.\n\nRonald can replenish his life bar by finding heart icons that are scattered throughout the level; the maximum number of hits that he can withstand before dying is five. From the second stage onward, the levels become more demanding with emphasis on making jumps from platform to platform while avoid bottomless pits. Items also become more difficult to reach and falling into a pit results in instantly losing a life. An enemy appears in the second level that resembles Little Red Riding Hood; although she causes damage like a normal enemy and cannot be destroyed by the player's apple bombs. A few of the bosses look like something out of a horror film instead of a kid-friendly 2D platform action game. The third boss looks like a giant mechanical dragon while the boss of level 5 is a bone dragon and players encounter a mentally ill disembodied head at the end of the eleventh level.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26770","CommunityRating":"2.8","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"10","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Data East","Publisher":"Data East"},"Dong Dong Nao II - Guo Zhong Ying Wen":{"Name":"Dong Dong Nao II: Guo Zhong Ying Wen","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"An Asian game to learn English.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"133581","CommunityRating":"1.25","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":{}},"Dong Fang De Chuan Shuo Zhi - Feng Yin Dao":{"Name":"Feng Yin Dao","ReleaseYear":"2005","Overview":"Feng Yin Dao (Chinese:东方的传说之-封印岛 lit.

Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three – the obstacle course – featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller's D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman's Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, \"Dallas\", Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. \"Prizes\" for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best \"ending\" by completing the last obstacle. The obstacle course's flag colour depended on which team was playing, if blue, the flags were blue, and if red, the flags were red.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1698","CommunityRating":"3.2857142857142856","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Rare","Publisher":"GameTek"},"Double Dragon":{"Name":"Double Dragon","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers who learned to fight on the cold, tough streets of the city.

Under the monk's care, Clovis began to learn various aspects of knowledge, including how to be a superior swordsman. When word reached the monk that King Lawrence's 16-year-old daughter Celia had been abducted and held by a fearsome dragon, who wished to break the kingdom's spirit and coerce the kingdom to do his bidding, Clovis felt a sense of duty to chase after the dragon and rescue Celia in the name of his father. In order to save his sister, he trained daily with the monk and learned to withstand injury, whether cut by swords or burned by flame, and still be just as capable a fighter as ever.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26778","CommunityRating":"2.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Namco"},"Dragon Buster II - Yami no Fuuin":{"Name":"Dragon Buster II: Yami no Fuuin","ReleaseDate":"1989-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The main hero named Carl is a dragon slayer who wields a bow and arrow.

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.\nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.\nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.\nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1700","CommunityRating":"4.2894736842105265","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_III","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"19","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Chunsoft","Publisher":"Enix"},"Dragon Warrior IV":{"Name":"Dragon Warrior IV","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-11T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Dragon Warrior IV differs from the rest of the series by breaking up the game into five distinct chapters, each of which focuses on a different protagonist or protagonists.

With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races.

At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively.

However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.\n\n\"Elysion\" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26785","CommunityRating":"0.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"System Soft","Publisher":"Tokyo Shoseki"},"Emoyan no 10 Bai Pro Yakyuu":{"Name":"Emoyan no 10 Bai Pro Yakyuu","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-19T00:00:00-08:00","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"127663","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Hect","Publisher":"Hect"},"Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken":{"Name":"Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken","ReleaseDate":"1988-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Erika to Satoru no Yume Bōken (えりかとさとるの夢冒険? lit. \"Erika and Satoru's Dream Adventure\") is a 1988 Japan-exclusive adventure video game for the Famicom.

Players use the menu commands to interact with the world: moving around, looking around, picking up objects, talking to people, etc. The setting of this game is 20th century Japan.\n\nIn a novel twist, the two characters of Erika and Satoru (who are depicted as twin schoolchildren) are independently playable - either a single player switches between the two, or a second player takes over the second twin. Both characters need to be in the same region to converse with NPCs, but are otherwise free to explore the map autonomously. Two-player adventure games are very rare; even in Japan. However, only one person can partake in the animal quiz portion. Failing the quiz will force the player(s) to start from the beginning.\n\nAn odd bit of infamy related to this game is a secret developer's message that can be found if the player inputs a list of button presses after waiting some time after the game ends. Inside of which is a litany of compliments and complaints to other co-workers, including some sexual insults which are deeply at odds with the child-friendly nature of the game.

A second version titled Family BASIC V3 was released on February 21, 1985, with greater memory and new features.\n\nSeveral visual components seen in Nintendo games, such as backgrounds and characters from Mario and Donkey Kong series games (c. 1984-1985), are made available as Family BASIC development componentry or have appeared in premade Family BASIC games.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"127891","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_BASIC","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Sandbox","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo"},"Family Circuit":{"Name":"Family Circuit","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-06T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Family Circuit is a Racing game, developed by Game Studio and published by Namco, which was released in Japan in 1988.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26829","CommunityRating":"2","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"Game Studio","Publisher":"Namco"},"Family Circuit '91":{"Name":"Family Circuit '91","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-19T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Family Circuit '91 is a Racing game, developed by Game Studio and published by Namco, which was released in Japan in 1991.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26830","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"Game Studio","Publisher":"Namco"},"Family Feud":{"Name":"Family Feud","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"In the NES version of Family Feud, the game tried to recreate the look and feel from the original Richard Dawson-hosted series, even going as far as to include a Dawson-like host who kissed the female characters in the game. (This differed from the game's packaging, which used the set from the Ray Combs era.) One or two players could play.\nJust like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round.\nA player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.\nOnce a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.\nIf a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of \"Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today\". Excuses used include \"tax considerations\" and \"a birth in the family\".","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"2906","CommunityRating":"2.9642857142857144","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"14","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Beam Software","Publisher":"GameTek"},"Family Jockey":{"Name":"Family Jockey","ReleaseDate":"1987-04-24T00:00:00-07:00","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"33248","CommunityRating":"3","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco"},"Family Mahjong":{"Name":"Family Mahjong","ReleaseDate":"1987-08-11T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Family Mahjong is another in a long line of mahjong games for the Famicom.

The goal is to beat the other opponents in four mini-games, each requiring that the player answer some Japanese trivia questions in order to proceed. The four mini-games are based on a game show, a board-game, the game of Othello, and a memory match game.

The goal of each stage is to put out all the fires. The fires are extinguished by either kicking an ice block into the flame, or dropping one from above. Dana's moveset includes the abilities to walk left and right across level ground. He can also climb on top of a solid block to his left or right, provided it is only one block tall and there is nothing on top of it. Dana can also push blocks of ice, which will then slide until they fall or hit a wall. Dana's most important ability is his ice magic. He can create and destroy blocks of ice. As the gameplay is grid-based, Dana's ice magic affects the squares beneath him and to the left and right, similar to Lode Runner. If the ice block is placed horizontally adjacent to a wall, pipe, jar, or another ice block, it will freeze to the adjacent surface.\n\nThere are also other elements that are introduced as the player progresses, including pipes (which Dana can travel through) and jars. Dana can walk across normal jars, but once a jar comes in contact with a flame, it begins to burn. Dana cannot walk across the top of burning jars, and any ice that is created in, or enters the square above a burning jar is destroyed. As players progress, the puzzles get more complicated and difficult. The simple gameplay must be used in new ways by players who wish to complete the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll6cMyWnHN4","DatabaseID":"20097","CommunityRating":"3.9375","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%27n_Ice","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"16","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Tecmo","Publisher":"Tecmo"},"Fire Dragon":{"Name":"Fire Dragon","Overview":"Fire Dragon is a Snake clone developed by Gamtec.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"133592","CommunityRating":"2","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"11","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Gamtec","Publisher":"BIC"},"Fire Emblem - Ankoku Ryuu to Hikari no Tsurugi":{"Name":"Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryuu to Hikari no Tsurugi","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Marth is prince of Altea and a direct descendant of Anri, the warrior who slew the shadow dragon Medeus.

While it supposedly depicts a battle between two fictional countries, the game is largely recognized to be a recreation of one of the crucial naval battles that occurred between Japan and the United States near the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nA couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the \"Turbo File,\" which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26846","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"ASCII Entertainment","Publisher":"Ascii Entertainment"},"Flight of the Intruder":{"Name":"Flight of the Intruder","ReleaseDate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"The player configures each plane's loadout for your mission, plans the mission package, then fly your missions.

Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yōkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.\n\nGegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.\n\nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26888","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Bandai","Publisher":"Bandai"},"Geimos":{"Name":"Geimos","ReleaseDate":"1985-08-28T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Geimos is an arcade style space shooter where players take control of a spaceship that flies over several different planets' surfaces destroying the incoming enemy units. \n\nThe game contains two different game modes. \"Mode A\" keeps the games camera perspective in the same position.

One day, Tippy has inflated a whole bunch of balloons when suddenly a strong wind blows. Tippy is blown away! The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.\n\nHello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid – a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.\n\nThroughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airborne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water.

Renouncing his previous life of violence, Gaou became a Buddhist sculptor, devoting himself to the creation of magnificent sculptures renowned for the raw and powerful emotions he was able to invoke in his work. One day, together with a fellow sculptor Akanemaru, Gaou encountered a mythical phoenix, who, according to legend, can bestow eternal life to those who drink its blood.

I found this name to be pretty strange, but once I started understanding what this game was all about, it made sense. It was released December 15, 1990 exclusively in Japan for the Famicom. It turns out Hissatsu Shigotonin is actually biased off of the popular Japanese historical drama TV series of the same name. The story of both focus on a group of ordinary \"work people\" who live double lives as assassins. It is an alternate Feudal Japan history (1603-1863) featuring fictional characters with elements of a parallel world. You must uncover a mystery though out the game, which comes though the story in episodes like the TV show. The player controls Nakamura Mondo, a fictional character who is also the star of the TV show. The game is biased on the original 84 episode run/first season of the TV series from 1979-1981 but features characters all the way up to the game’s release date. The show continues to this day with Assassins as a subtitle. This seems like a really cool concept for a weekly episodic series. The story has an almost assassins creed feel. I’m sure the idea of everyday people turned into warriors has been around in stories forever, but the setting and time period makes it stand out. Japan’s feudal era is one of the most intense of all the time periods in earth’s history. It was a time of Samurai, Ninja and technology that eventually killed off said Samurai and Ninja. One of the biggest draws of the era is the is the fantastic culture that knew of the outside world, but worked hard in maintaining isolation making them truly unique. The main character, Nakamura Mondo, is a corrupt cop known for accepting bribes who is disrespected by his superiors, and mother-in-law. He ends up bringing together a group of people that have all been wronged in some way, formed to solve mysteries and assassinate targets. The heroes play by the same rules as the villains, as they are not afraid to use underhanded tactics to get the job done. Each episode of the show usually climaxes with the killing of the target, sometimes in an almost humorous manner such as a flower through the skull. I was able to find a random episode but no dubs or subs, which is a bummer since I wanted to learn more of the story. It seems to hold up well to time, has a campy feel to it and comes off like a live action anime. Check out this trailer for one of their many movies to get a better idea of the style, think Al Bundy the Samuri and his gang of misfits.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L9JvS2VpuI","DatabaseID":"133598","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Arc System Works Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Banpresto Co., Ltd."},"Hit Marmot":{"Name":"Hit Marmot","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":"Hit Marmot is another concoction by Mega Soft, which makes use of the Zapper peripheral.

Each team is made up of three players -- two forwards and a goal tender. The object of the game is to shoot the puck into the other team's goal.\n\nThe game offers fights, trips, body slams, shattering glass, blazing shots, head-over-heels bone crushing hits, hacking, slashing, spearing, elbowing and all out knock-down, punching, crunching action. You don't need to know any rules about hockey to enjoy Hit The Ice -- the ultimate red-blooded sport. There is fast paced end to end action, heart stopping incredible saves, booming slapshots, impossible in-the-air 360 degree cartwheel supershots all with some good natured humor thrown in.\n\nPlayers can purchase Power Drinks in the locker room between periods for an additional credit. The drink promises \"Skate Faster, Shoot Harder, It really, Really works!\" At the start of the next period the player will undergo a wild cartoon-like transformation that turns the character into a maniac for the next minute of play.\n\nThe game was briefly reviewed in Nintendo Power Volume 47 and was scheduled for release in April 1993. Conversely, it was reviewed again in the next issue and slated for a May 1993 release. It then received a full review in Volume 49. Ultimately, the game was never officially published.","MaxPlayers":"4","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4PBcMP8kvk","DatabaseID":"130477","CommunityRating":"4.708333333333333","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"12","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Taito"},"Hogan's Alley":{"Name":"Hogan's Alley","ReleaseDate":"1984-06-12T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"You need split-second timing and sharp-shooting accuracy to join the FBI.

Much like its inspiration, players take turns moving around the board, which is divided into districts made up of multiple properties. Landing on a property allows you to buy it, and owning multiple properties in the same district increases their value, but landing on a property owned by another player forces you to pay them based on the property's value. A key element is the ability to invest in districts by purchasing stock, even if the player owns no property in that district, which increases the value of those properties and gives the player a cut of any transactions involving that district.

The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well.

The scene is the town's main street, with a view from behind the Sheriff's back (the view is so close that only the Sheriff's waist, right arm and gun are visible). Various other characters appear on the main street in front of the Sheriff.\n\nThe actual gameplay mostly concerns the Sheriff discussing with the various characters via a selection menu similar to those in contemporary graphical adventures. For each line the other character says, the game offers a selection of four different responses, and the discussion progresses depending on the chosen response. Law of the West marks the first use of this now-common interaction style.\n\nAs well as the discussion, the Sheriff occasionally gets involved in gunfights. In this case, the gameplay becomes a pure test of shooting skills, as the Sheriff has to shoot his opponent before getting shot himself. Gunplay is accomplished by pushing up on the joystick to draw the weapon, which causes a joystick-controlled crosshairs to appear on the screen. The various characters would react if the Sheriff drew his gun before they had a chance to say their opening line, usually refusing to speak until the gun was put away.\n\nIf the Sheriff gets shot, he blacks out, and the doctor is called to help. Depending on the Sheriff's previous interaction with the doctor and the other characters in the game (and if the doctor's in town), he may either be healed, or left for dead (either by the doctor refusing to help, or the doctor being drunk at the time). The only goal of the game is for the player to make it alive to the end of the day; if the player wishes he can gun down every character he meets without talking to them albeit this will be reflected negatively in the final score.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27174","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Pony Canyon"},"Lawn Mower by shiru (PD)":{"Name":"Lawn Mower","ReleaseDate":"2011-05-28T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The goal of this game is to mow all the grass before you run out of gas.

The screen always scrolls from left to right. No backtracking is permitted on any level.

The handgun is the player's initial weapon; but more powerful weapons can be found just by exploring. Certain blocks can be broken by using the player's chosen weapon; the difference between destroyable blocks and non-destroyable blocks is sometimes indistinguishable.\n\nBonus levels distributed throughout the game allows players to destroy entire squadrons of enemy ships while being completely impervious to their attacks.

Later rounds also feature Jumbo Tires that bounce towards the Runner, Walls that emerge from the ground before receding back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto the Runner and slow him down, and Chess Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another.\n\nThe rounds also feature Springboards, which can be used to propel the Runner forward at a great speed. Some rounds have a special layout of Springboards, where it is possible to use one Springboard to land directly on the second one. Some other rounds also feature Skateboards which will speed the Runner up and make him immune to Slip Zones. There are also two different types of drink cans; kicking them will either gain the player bonus points (from 100 to 5000) or speed the Runner up, but jumping on them will stop the timer for a few seconds.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27202","CommunityRating":"2.75","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"Now Production","Publisher":"Namco"},"Metroid":{"Name":"Metroid","ReleaseDate":"1986-08-06T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"You’re inside the fortress planet Zebes.

It is based on Fujiko Fujio A's (the pen name of Motoo Abiko) Japanese manga series of the same name, which later became an anime series and Asian franchise. The game was released around the same time the anime was aired. It was the fifth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,500,000 copies in its lifetime.\n\nThe plot begins when a young ninja name Kanzo Hattori was in search of his master in order to complete his training. While searching for his master, he encountered a young 10-year old boy name Ken (Ken'ichi) Mitsobahis and made him his temporary replacement master, in order to develop Ken's confidence, while they went on many adventures together.

Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! \"Lettuce check it out,\" urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. \"I yam King Kale,\" he says, \"Won't you peas peas help me?\" Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.\n\nIt seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and \"vegetable-themed\" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.\n\nOur two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"18788","CommunityRating":"3.6666666666666665","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"Jaleco Entertainment","Publisher":"Jaleco Entertainment"},"Ninja Jajamaru-kun":{"Name":"Ninja Jajamaru-kun","ReleaseDate":"1985-11-15T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Take on the role of a ninja called Jajamaru and rescue the captured Princess Sakura from the evil Namazu Dayuu in this action-packed game.\n\nJajamaru must use his throwing stars to defeat the monsters lurking in each of Dayuus many hideouts.

However, the other enemies can still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the pylons. The city is divided into roads for automobile traffic and sidewalks for roaming pedestrian dogs in overalls.

Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player.

The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins. \n\nIn addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win. These include \"Attack of the Paint Zombies\" (similar to Space Invaders), \"The Warehouse Shuffle\" (moving crates from one side of a warehouse to another as gremlins try to steal them), \"Four Alarm Rescue\" (catching people as they jump out of windows), and \"Leapin' Energy Casules!\" (capturing energy balls to fuel your spaceship). \n\nThere are also other game modes that enable you to use cards you may have for an actual Pictionary board game or a practice mode enabling you to simply draw.","MaxPlayers":"4","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"2006","CommunityRating":"2.5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Software Creations","Publisher":"LJN"},"Pin Bot":{"Name":"Pin Bot","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Pin Bot is a conversion of the arcade pinball game by Williams Electronics.

It is the third game in Babylonian Castle Saga series which started with the 1984 arcade game, The Tower of Druaga.\n\nThe story of The Quest of Ki is actually a prequel to the original Tower of Druaga. It occurs shortly after the demon Druaga has stolen the Blue Crystal Rod and taken it to his tower. The goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to the tower in order to retrieve it. The game then follows her doomed quest to the top of the tower, and leads directly into the story of the original game.\n\nThe game is a side-scrolling platformer with one hundred levels. In each level, the player's goal is to pick up a key and open the door leading to the next area. Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each floor, and any contact with them results in death.\n\nKi has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds.\n\nMany of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps. Each stage in the game contains one or more treasure chest, which hold various items. Although many of the items bestow helpful abilities, the effects only last for the floor on which they were found.\n\nAfter completing the game, players can gain access to forty bonus stages. These stages contain cameos from the Pac-Man ghosts and the enemies from Dig Dug.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"30942","CommunityRating":"5","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Game Studio","Publisher":"Namco"},"R.B.I.

Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox. \n\nThe gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games.

Besides interrogating people for information, or simply beating them up for train fare, Holmes must search seemingly random cracks or trees in order to find important clues, or inventory items.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27271","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"Towa Chiki","Publisher":"Towa Chiki"},"Shi Kong Zhi Lun":{"Name":"Shi Kong Zhi Lun","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"Shi Kong Zhi Lun, also known as Chrono Trigger (erroneously Cnrono Trigger on the title screen) is a backport of the original Squaresoft SNES game, made by Shenzhen Nanjing Technology Co., Ltd. for the Famicom.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"154229","WikipediaURL":"http://bootleggames.wikia.com/wiki/Shi_Kong_Zhi_Lun","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Shenzhen Nanjing Technology","Publisher":"Shenzhen Nanjing Technology"},"Shin 4 Nin Uchi Mahjong - Yakuman Tengoku":{"Name":"Shin 4 Nin Uchi Mahjong: Yakuman Tengoku","ReleaseDate":"1991-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The sole installment of the Yakuman series on the Famicom.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExoRhFYbVcA","DatabaseID":"142066","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Board Game","Developer":"Chat Noir","Publisher":"Nintendo"},"Shin Moero!!

In particular, the game is based on the 1983 live-action movie, localized in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai which in turn was based on a 1982 reworking of the epic novel named Shin Satomi Hakkenden.\n\nThe game has a then-distinct feature of being able to start the game as any of the eight samurai, each of which begins the game in a different location. Their goal is to meet up and recruit their brothers, eventually forming a group of eight. The game is otherwise standard for the genre: the player splits their time between exploring towns and talking to NPCs, and fighting monsters and enemy soldiers in dungeons and the overworld map via a turn-based combat system.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr3UiAo2YkM","DatabaseID":"133785","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Micronics","Publisher":"Toei Animation"},"Shingen The Ruler":{"Name":"Shingen the Ruler","ReleaseDate":"1989-08-21T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"You are SHINGEN, 16th century samurai warlord.

The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it.

Despite being mostly complete, it was never commercially released. Also, unlike most video games of this time, it was never even announced. Most cancelled games saw months' worth of publicity in video game magazines before fading off the game-watch radars. The gameplay is very similar to Sunsoft's Batman games, Batman and Batman: Return of the Joker, in that the character can run, jump, punch and duck, although in this game the player can also fly simply by pushing up. There are also some side scrolling flying levels where you can shoot laser/heat vision from your eyes. The game is divided into five scenes with one-four areas with a boss at the end of each area.\n\nThe game features a superhero, named Sunman. He is very reminiscent of Superman with his cape, and flying abilities, as well as the games title screen seems to match that of the Superman logo. Sunsoft's involvement with other DC Comics character licenses lead some to speculate that Sunman was intended to be a Superman game, but DC for whatever reason decided not to go along and the game had some changes made to lose the likeness. In an interview with planner/director Kenji Eno, it was confirmed that this was originally intended to be a Superman game.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"22455","CommunityRating":"4.333333333333333","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Action","Developer":"EIM"},"Super Arabian":{"Name":"Super Arabian","ReleaseDate":"1985-07-25T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"An action platformer styled as an Arabian Nights-flavored \"storybook\", which follows the trials of a brave Arabian prince as he attempts to infiltrate the palace and save a princess locked in the tower.

This comparison is also true for the sport of badminton itself, which has a similar focus on performing hard-to-counter spike attacks close to the net in order to score points.

After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.\n\nThis title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.\n\nTo further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27302","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Pax Softonica","Publisher":"Vap"},"Super Rugby":{"Name":"Super Rugby","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-27T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Super Rugby is a Sports game, developed by Zap and published by TSS, which was released in Japan in 1989.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27289","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Zap","Publisher":"TSS"},"Super Shinobi, The":{"Name":"The Super Shinobi","Overview":"The Super Shinobi is a port of Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master, (rather than The Revenge of Shinobi which was sold in Japan under this game's title.) made for the Famicom by Super Game.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsBjl5nszlw","DatabaseID":"152043","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{},"Developer":"Super Game","Publisher":"Super Game"},"Super Spike V'Ball":{"Name":"Super Spike V'Ball","ReleaseDate":"1990-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Warm up with a few exercise games then face contenders in the American Circuit.

The instrumental songs played in the game were: Offside Way, Crushing Light, and Faraway Dream. On the promotional flyer for this video game, a Formula One racing vehicle was shown with the Ford logo shown on the vehicle.

The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.\n\nAll of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a \"tetris\". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called \"Easy Spin\" in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"1424","CommunityRating":"4.3125","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"64","Genres":"Puzzle; Strategy","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Nintendo"},"Tetris 2":{"Name":"Tetris 2","ReleaseDate":"1993-09-21T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The mesmerizing fun of Tetris returns - and the challenge escalates to new heights!

There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.\n\nTetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.\n\nBomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.\n\nBomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"115796","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Chunsoft","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software"},"Tetsudou Ou - Famicom Boardgame":{"Name":"Tetsudou Ou: Famicom Boardgame","ReleaseDate":"1987-12-12T00:00:00-08:00","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"127889","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"dB-SOFT","Publisher":"dB-Soft"},"Tetsuwan Atom":{"Name":"Tetsuwan Atom","ReleaseDate":"1988-02-26T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Tetsuwan Atom (鉄腕アトム?) is an action game developed by Home Data and published by Konami for the Famicom in Japan early on in 1988.

If the player takes too long in any one world, a massive vision-obscuring storm will roll in and make the game considerably more difficult to play.

Its hack & slash combat included the ability to both attack with a sword by pressing the attack button and defend with a shield by standing still. It attracted millions of fans in Japan and went on to inspire early action RPGs such as Dragon Slayer, Hydlide, Ys and The Legend of Zelda. The game also debuted the Slime monsters which would later become the mascot of the Dragon Quest series.\n\nThe game served the basis of an anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk, from studio Gonzo and was broadcast between April 2008 to March 2009. The anime takes place 60 years after the events of the game.

The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.\n\nOnce the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ?) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク?) mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the \"neutral gangs.\" These \"neutral gangs\" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying \"no\" when asked to fight (たたかい?, \"Struggle\").\n\nNeutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game.\n\nThat means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either move (いどうし?, \"Not among\") his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn. It is possible for a player to transfer all of his gang members out of a territory, turning it into a blank grey territory without a number.","MaxPlayers":"3","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27327","CommunityRating":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Sammy Studios","Publisher":"Sammy Studios"},"Tsuri Kichi Sanpei - Blue Marlin Hen":{"Name":"Tsuri Kichi Sanpei: Blue Marlin Hen","ReleaseDate":"1988-03-17T00:00:00-08:00","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"127886","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Victor Interactive Software","Publisher":"Victor Interactive Software"},"Twin Cobra":{"Name":"Twin Cobra","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"You pilot the TC-17 Twin Cobra assault helicopter to fight the forces of Commander Anziga, the myopic leader of the nation of Kaban.

He lives in a modern-day Tokyo with his father, but his family line stretches back to the samurai days of Japan. Five hundred years ago a demon was terrorizing the land. Ushio's ancestor, wielding a magical spear from China, managed to bind the monster to a rock with an artifact. Unable to kill the demon, he built a temple around it and stayed there as a monk in order to make sure it won't escape. Ushio finds the demon still tied to the rock in the basement of one of the temple buildings. Unfortunately, by breaking the seal on the doors to the basement, Ushio has released the demon's evil energy, which attracts other monsters. Ushio calls the demon Tora, because it reminds him of a tiger (Tora is Japanese for tiger). Tora has to stick with Ushio, because he holds the magical spear, and to help him to defeat his own evil will! The game plays like a traditional Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based battles, where Ushio uses his family magic, and Tora his demonic abilities.

All the animals were docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Taros, and other races mingled with one another and worked to make Marvel Land into an increasingly beautiful place to live. A large clock tower resembling a stone grandfather clock stood watch over the countryside of Marvel Land. Long ago, an ancient evil had been sealed within the clock tower. The people needn't fret, however. For those days had long since passed, or so they had thought.\n\nThe Key of Time that rested in the center of the face of the clock tower had long since been used to seal away the ancient evil that lies within. Until one day, the clock tower mysteriously stopped working. In an effort to rewind the clock, a villager takes it upon himself to do just that. Fumbling with the key, the villager drops the Key of Time, foolishly. In a frantic manner, the villager picks up the key and tries to reset it back into place before a catastrophe befalls Marvel Land. But then, it was too late for the villager to accomplish the task. The ancient evil of legend, Zouna, the dark wizard who manipulates time itself was unleashed upon the world once more. And to prevent anyone else from sealing him away once again, Zouna takes the Key of Time for himself.\n\nFinally freed after many years, Zouna wastes no time in wreaking havoc and chaos over Marvel Land. Zouna unleashes his manifested darkness over the land, and lays waste to the countryside. Feeling confident in his reign, Zouna constructs his castle in which to preside over Marvel Land from. The peaceful inhabitants of Marvel Land cried out in terror as Zouna's manifested darkness came after them one by one. Zouna's darkness corrupted the hearts of anyone it came across, and possessed them against their wills. Once thriving towns and villages fell into ruination. Family members were parted from their loved ones. Only a few scattered towns remained standing; forming a last bastion in resistance to Zouna's dark invasion. A futile effort. Even Kurino Sandra would come to meet his heroic demise, subdued by Zouna's power. Marvel Land is in dire need of a savior.\n\nThe desperate call has been answered by the heavens. The child of the gods, Valkyrie, a fledgling maiden descends to Marvel Land from heaven. Her first adventure, she wields a simple shield and a short sword (a mace of light in the remake), vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness that has consumed it. Then her adventure to defeat the evil Zouna begins.\n\nThe game has a scrolling overworld like Dragon Warrior/Quest, with a real-time combat system similar to The Legend of Zelda. The player controls Valkyrie in her quest to defeat Zouna and restore peace to Marvel Land. With brown hair and no helmet, she begins the game armed with only a short sword. The player helps Valkyrie fight monsters, collect gold and find stronger equipment which will increase her powers; eventually, she finds a helmet and cloak. With the people of Marvel Land terrorized or controlled by Zouna, she receives no hints or advice. The player must devise a plan to defeat Zouna, with many of Valkyrie's tasks not immediately apparent; some can only be guessed by exploration and experimentation.\n\nWhen Valkyrie defeats a monster, she earns experience points towards the next level and (usually) a small amount of money. Although money is scarce in Marvel Land, the player rarely needs it to buy equipment. All the game's items can be obtained for free if the player knows where to look. In addition to equipping weapons and armor, Valkyrie gains access to seven spells. When she learns each one depends on her intelligence, which increases with each level of experience. The first, and possibly the most valuable, of these is the healing spell.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eLuLJ5sFK8","DatabaseID":"97351","CommunityRating":"2.5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie_no_B%C5%8Dken:_Toki_no_Kagi_Densetsu","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco"},"Vegas Connection - Casino Kara Ai wo Komete":{"Name":"Vegas Connection: Casino kara Ai o Komete","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-24T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Vegas Connection: Casino kara Ai o Komete is a 1989 Nintendo Family Computer video game that was released exclusively in Japan.\n\nThe player-controlled character Roberto is staying in Las Vegas with his girlfriend Marian in a motel room on a romantic vacation.

One day he encounter a fortune teller who sends him on a quest to find information about the six books of Ys. It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long Adol learns that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in the Sega Master System version, Malificus in the English-language computer versions). It is Adol's task to defeat the villain and discover the secret of Ys!\n\nYs is an action role-playing game with its own trademark combat system: instead of pressing the \"attack\" button, the protagonist simply runs into the enemies he encounters. More damage is inflicted upon the enemies if Adol charges at them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in the hero's death if the monster is stronger than him. The player gains gold and experience points for defeating foes; once enough experience has been accumulated, Adol levels up and becomes stronger. The hero can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx2hDGpVMco","DatabaseID":"23300","CommunityRating":"4","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_I:_Ancient_Ys_Vanished","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Advance Communication Company","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries"},"Ys II - Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter":{"Name":"Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter","ReleaseDate":"1990-05-25T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"A bright light shot up from Darm Tower in the end of the first Ys, and Adol Christin is awakened by a young girl who finds him lying on the ground.

But finding the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop an evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. And his foes already know where he is.\n\nYs II: Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter is a direct sequel to Ys. The game continues to utilize the action role-playing combat style of the first installment, which requires the player to make the protagonist run into the enemy in order to cause damage, without the need to press an attack button. The player should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise the hero will be killed. The player character can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade weapons and inventory, like in most other RPGs.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpQx9_LlOTo","DatabaseID":"23299","CommunityRating":"2.6428571428571428","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_II:_Ancient_Ys_Vanished_–_The_Final_Chapter","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Advance Communication Company","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries"},"Ys III - Wanderers From Ys":{"Name":"Ys III: Wanderers from Ys","ReleaseDate":"1991-09-27T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Adol Christin's long-time friend, Dogi, wishes to return to his home town of Redmont after hearing about strange disturbances that are happening there.

Beside changing the battle system, the game's perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now. New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding.
