After Burner II is, quite simply, one of the most mindless shooters that you're ever likely to play: simply fly your F-14 into the screen, dodging missiles like crazy and letting all hell loose with your vulcan cannon. There is precious little strategy - even less than Space Harrier, and often luck plays more of a part than skill. The action is split up by the occasional bonus stage - a run through a canyon blowing up anything that dares to exist in front of you. Fuelling planes and landing strips also make a regular appearance.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmKDAV12Mow","DatabaseID":"20228","CommunityRating":"3.6153846153846154","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Burner_II","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"13","Genres":"Shooter","Developer":"Bits Laboratory","Publisher":"NEC"},"Air Zonk":{"Name":"Air Zonk","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"The Evil King Drool has sent forth powerful cyber robots to carry out his evil designs.

The game is divided up into different areas, each represented by a map screen. Within these areas, you can choose your route to the end (by exiting levels at certain points). Throughout each area you have to find a 'master key' allowing you access to the boss - this can be hard to locate at times and requires lots of shooting at blank areas of screen just in case.\n\nControl of your character is original - on each stage you have three characters which you can choose between, with the CPU controlled ones following behind you like some bizarre congo line. The characters are preset and vary from stage to stage, and each one has different attributes. For example, some have very high jumping ability, whereas others are poor at jumping but have spread-shot weapons. Once you have found the master key and reached the final level in the area, you are entered into a boss battle, where you sit astride the titular donkey and attempt to fight your way to the next area.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwZbCGPvayA","DatabaseID":"20230","CommunityRating":"2.8333333333333335","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Action; Platform","Developer":"Westone","Publisher":"Hudson Soft"},"Artist Tool":{"Name":"Artist Tool","ReleaseDate":"1991-10-18T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"A unique piece of software for the PC Engine, Artist Tool is a graphics program that allows you to draw and print your own artwork when combined with the 'Illust Booster', 'Print Booster' and 'Photo Reader'.

It can be fiddly at first, but it's essential that you master it.\n\nThe four weapons available are variable in quality. The forward shot and diagonal shot are both only useful when you've lost the other weapons, as the missile and full-fire are the ones that you will utilise most often. The missile is particularly useful as in some levels you are required to blast away areas of wall to progress.

To do this, you have a long pink tongue that shoots out to swallow any critters in your way, you then have to spit them out into the gaping maws of hungry plants dotted around the level. But being a lizard, you are seemingly unable to jump, so to navigate your way around, you have a tail that shoots upwards to catch on to any grippable areas of platform above.

He's also a monumental lecher who only accepts beautiful female clients and will do anything to get a peek at their bodies. But keeping watch on him is his partner Kaori, sister to his ex-partner who was killed on one fateful night. Kaori has talents herself, being able to produce enormous mallets seemingly from thin air whenever Ryo is acting up around the ladies - and she isn't afraid to use them.\n\nCity Hunter is based on the very popular manga/anime by Tsukasa Hojo. The game itself is a kind of action/adventure split into several different 'stories', of which you can choose in any order (with the exception of the final chapter). Gameplay mostly involves running around buildings, shooting the bad guys that constantly appear ahead of you and trying out the doorways scattered around. These doors often lead to separate rooms, sometimes with that essential character in that you need to talk to to progress the story. Aside from armed mobsters, you'll also have to navigate around laser beams, crushing machines and spikes that shoot from the ground. Around each level you will also find a nurse to heal you - although stumbling into a room with a semi-naked gal inside has pretty much the same effect. As you progress through the levels, you also gain extra weaponry - the bazooka being particularly useful in a crowded room.","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBaHnbwccP0","DatabaseID":"18402","WikipediaURL":"http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/City_Hunter.htm","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Sunsoft","Publisher":"Sunsoft"},"Columns":{"Name":"Columns","ReleaseDate":"1991-03-29T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Columns was one of the many Tetris-like puzzles that appeared after that game's great success in the late 1980s.  It takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen \"Columns\"\n\nWhile a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.\n\nIf, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.\n\nOccasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel Column appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.\n\nThe columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with Jewels.\n\nSome ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. \"Flash columns\" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. \"Doubles\" allows two players work together in the same well. \"Time trial\" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"23255","CommunityRating":"4.5","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega"},"Cratermaze":{"Name":"Cratermaze","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Cratermaze is an action puzzle game viewed from an overhead perspective.

There are also several bosses encountered throughout the game.\n\nThe Japanese release, Doraemon: Meikyu Daisakusen, features popular children's character Doraemon and his friends.

This game is intended for experienced role-playing gamers only. The random encounters are high even for a Japanese role-playing game with a mid-to-late 1992 Super Famicom release date (i.e., Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride) and the combat sequences (using melee attacks in addition to missiles and guns) are extremely slow.\n\nThe game was only released commercially in Japan.\n\nIn the 24th century, mankind has expanded into the reaches of outer space.[2] Meanwhile, the Earth had already disappeared as the center of human civilization. Each star system served as independent nation; war had occurred between these \"countries\" several times in the past. This led to a high demand for mercenaries to fight these wars for money. Some of these mercenaries went on to become space pirates due to their insatiable demand for wealth.\n\nThe crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates. Suddenly, the battle takes a turn for the worse and the crew activate their jump drive without a destination.  They end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties. Even the captain was killed while en route to the mysterious destination. Only 26 of the crew survive, and only six of them are qualified for combat operations: the commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor. They are responsible for using the six giant \"Module\" mechanized suits available for them after the fight with the space pirates. They discover a human colony that is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed \"Berserkers\".\n\nThe crew must fight back against the new alien threat and explore the galaxy in order to find a way to return to Earth.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"23256","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Knight","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Group SNE","Publisher":"Tonkin House"},"Darius Alpha":{"Name":"Darius Alpha","ReleaseDate":"1990-03-16T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"It's a straight run through only the bosses from Darius Plus.

Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that \"outer space\" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.\n\nYes, fish.\n\nNot even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.\n\nThe requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.\n\nThe arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.\n\nLooking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.\n\nDarius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.\n\nWhen various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.\n\nIt was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, PC Engine, PC Engine (Super CD-ROM), Wii (Virtual Console), and ZX Spectrum.\n\nThe PC Engine saw three releases:  \n\nDarius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines.\n\nDarius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).\n\nSuper Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen. Features new bosses, as well as a \"boss rush\" mode.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27093","CommunityRating":"4","Platform":"NEC TurboGrafx-16","CommunityRatingCount":"9","Genres":"Shooter","Developer":"Taito","Publisher":"NEC"},"Darkwing Duck":{"Name":"Darkwing Duck","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"The kingpins of crime are at it again!
