Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.\n\nYour spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.\n\nPlay takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"18940","CommunityRating":"1.7272727272727273","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrobat_Mission","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"11","Genres":"Shooter","Developer":"Micronics","Publisher":"Teichiku"},"ActRaiser":{"Name":"ActRaiser","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-16T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Restore peace and order to your people's world!

In order to do this, she must populate a kingdom she has been given before her rival and fellow Queen candidate, Rosalia, can do the same.

If the player wins the contest, Angelique becomes the new Queen.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\n\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\n\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.\n\nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"9054","CommunityRating":"3.6176470588235294","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamut_Lagoon","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","CommunityRatingCount":"17","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Squaresoft","Publisher":"Squaresoft"},"Bakukyuu Renpatsu!!

Japan, controlled by the feudal rulers (shoguns) of the Tokugawa dynasty, consumed by a peaceful sleep for three hundred years, was awoken by the arrival of the Westerners. It seemed that they only wanted the end of Japan's isolation from the rest of the world. But their true purpose was to take control of a mysterious Japanese energy source called reiketsu. To protect those sources, that were running dry during their three hundred years-long reign, the Tokugawa Shoguns formed the famous Shinsengumi special force. In addition to its primary mission of clearing out forces that would try to overthrow the shogunate, there also existed a special branch of them called \"Shadow Shinsengumi\". The duty of the \"Shadow\" was to take care of \"those things the human hand cannot manage\"...\n\nYou control Yamatomaru, a strong-willed sixteen-year-old boy who lives in Iida village, near Koufu. His father has recently passed away. After failing to defeat a monster in his village, he was saved by one of the Shadow Shinsengumi man, Mibu Juurota. As he receives his father's katana, he goes on his first mission - rescuing boys who were trapped in a mountain path. Soon the plot thickens and the young hero becomes involved in mystical struggles between the forces who try to control reiketsu...\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Dragon Quest series and other Japanese-style RPGs: the battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. You fight using physical attacks and a variety of special moves based on spiritual energy. An unusual addition to the gameplay is the karma system. By doing good deeds you can increase your karma level, in an Ultima-like way. This way you get more money and precious items from fighting monsters, and your special powers increase in strength. If you don't show compassion, steal people's things and lie, your karma will decrease, you won't get money from random battles, and some people will attack you.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"33886","CommunityRating":"1.4","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"10","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Pandora Box","Publisher":"Banpresto"},"Barbarossa":{"Name":"Barbarossa","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Strategy game based on WWII barbarossa campaign.

Still, on 18 December 1940, Hitler authorized an invasion of the Soviet Union for a start date of 15 May 1941, but this was not met; instead, the invasion began on 22 June 1941. Over the course of the operation, about four million soldiers of the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union along a 2,900-kilometer (1,800 mi) front, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare. In addition to troops, the Germans employed some 600,000 motor vehicles and between 600–700,000 horses.

Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.","MaxPlayers":"4","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"90302","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Jockey","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Nova Games","Publisher":"Virgin Interactive"},"Battle Pinball":{"Name":"Battle Pinball","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-24T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Battle Pinball is a multi-table pinball game exclusive for the Super Famicom and part of Banpresto's \"Compati Hero Series\" that brings together the licenses for Ultraman, Kamen Rider and Gundam.

Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the \"stacks\" of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.\n\nChinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of a much larger city.

If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat.

They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...\n\nThe game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the \"good\" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called \"Soul Power\", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5uQFviNoIc","DatabaseID":"3548","CommunityRating":"2.5","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Westone","Publisher":"Enix"},"Dark Kingdom":{"Name":"Dark Kingdom","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-29T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The object is to play an evil mercenary named Gene Dorman.

The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form.

One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a \"world map\": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"19069","CommunityRating":"2.875","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Dragon","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"8","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Alfa System","Publisher":"Media Works"},"Emmitt Smith Football":{"Name":"Emmitt Smith Football","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Emmitt Smith, considered to be one of the greatest running backs in professional football, is now crashing into your living room.

It eventually was retooled and released on various 32 bit platforms as Grid Runner. A prototype rom has been dumped.\n\nEurit is an action game that was being developed by Radical. The game is basically a souped up version of childhood games of Tag and Capture the Flag. The game features a split-screen and is an ideal two player game. A near complete beta of this game was discovered, and it is probably one of the best unreleased games for the snes.\n\nThe story behind the game is that the ruler of the galaxy decides that he will retire. In order to find a suitable replacement, he sets up a tournament where wizards and warriors compete to determine who shall be ruler. Throughout the game, you travel to many worlds across the galaxy to prove your might.\n\nThere are four characters to chose from at the start of the game. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses, based on their speed, spellcasting agility, and magic capacity. Through my playthrough, I used the average character.\n\nThe gameplay is very addictive, and relatively easy to get into. Basically, one of the characters starts off being \"it\". The person who is it cannot capture flags, so they must chase down the other character and touch them. Once you are not it, you can collect flags necessary to win the stage.\n\nComplicating the game is the obstacles you face. To proceed through the level, you basically have to build platforms. There are many levels with enemy creatures that usually require a number of blasts with your gun to kill. Speed tiles send you running really quickly, which can either make you quickly escape your foe, or send you far away from him.\n\nProbably the most compelling gameplay feature for experts is the magic system. Before each level, you learn a new magic spell. Some spells are mundane, like destroying a platform, but others can devistate your opponent, like the spell that causes all the creatures in the level to attack your opponent. Powerup balls throughout the level allow you to charge your magic meter.\n\nThe music is pretty typical \"sci-fi game\" fare, comparible to games like Blackthorne, B.O.B., and The Lost Vikings. The sound effects are somewhat muted, though the voice that tells you \"player 1 is now it\" is really well done. The graphics aren't anything too special, but they do the job.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"122730","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Radical Entertaiment"},"Extra Innings":{"Name":"Extra Innings","ReleaseDate":"1992-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"The eye-popping new 16-bit \"Extra Innings\" for your Super NES puts you in the batter's box, on the pitcher's mound, even in the manager's shoes.

The landmass was large enough to classify as an island in 2002 and all authority and proprietary rights was granted to the United Nations.\"). Roid's fiancee, Karen Meure, is already inside. However, the uneasy quiet is broken when a USN Wanzer squad led by an officer named Driscoll ambushes Meure on the premises. Driscoll himself kills her, setting the stage for the game's first mission, called \"The Larcus Incident.\"\n\nAfter the player defeats the rest of the USN force, Driscoll escapes, but not before he detonates bombs inside the complex.\n\nThe entire incident is pinned on Roid and Sakata, who are summarily dismissed from the OCU Ground Defense Force. The fiasco also broke a peace treaty between the OCU and USN, setting off the Second Huffman War. One year later, OCU Colonel Guri Olson seeks out Roid (who is a Wanzer fighter in the western town of Barinden) to work with the Canyon Crows mercenary unit. Roid joins after Olson dangles the prospect of killing the USN officer responsible for Karen's death.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3623","CommunityRating":"4.3461538461538458","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Mission_(video_game)","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"13","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"G-Craft","Publisher":"Squaresoft"},"Fun 'N Games":{"Name":"Fun 'n Games","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Fun 'N Games brings out the Artist, the Musician, the Designer, even the Astronaut in your child!

Eight different players can become the captain of the player's team and the team can use one of five different formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero). All of the formations are used in modern day soccer except for the WM formation (which saw common use in England during the 1930s). The star player (captain) chosen kicks a shot (super shot or hyper shot) that pushes the goalkeeper into the stands, just like in Hat Trick Hero. Exhibition, world league (similar to a World Cup tournament) and Taito Cup (24 teams to beat) are the three possible variations in the game. After beating all the 23 national teams in the Taito cup mode, there is a final game against a team with the abbreviation \"NLC\".

The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent's stack to descend faster.\n\nThere are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent's stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen. This causes a disjunction of colors that may make it more difficult for the other player to clear their stack.

Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.\n\nSion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.\nSurlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins\nRiza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.\n\nRudra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.\n\nThe game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable \"Ig\" represents fire and the syllable \"ga\" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore \"Igga\" is a more powerful version than \"Ig\" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"24040","CommunityRating":"3.8333333333333335","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_of_the_Rudras","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"9","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Square","Publisher":"Square"},"Ruin Arm":{"Name":"Ruin Arm","ReleaseDate":"1995-06-23T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Ruin Arm (ルインアーム) is a 1995 Japan-exclusive Action role-playing video game for the Super Famicom.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"34798","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Bandai"},"Run Saber":{"Name":"Run Saber","ReleaseDate":"1993-06-08T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The year is 2998 and the Earth is hopelessly polluted.

In order to get vengeance on his peers he performs a ceremony in the gym (most likely referencing the original Megami Tensei) that transports his high school into Makai, the netherworld, where he has somehow become powerful enough to become Majin-Nou (Demon God Emperor). Back at the school, everyone freaks out and is scared except for a select few.The player assumes the role a nameless male or female student, who armed themselves with defensive equipment and COMP. They investigate the realms of Makai which are based on 5 of the 7 deadly sins, and finally face off against Hazama. In their quest, the player will be accompanied by fellow students and demons recruited through either negotiation or from the process of fusion, or via the Jakyou.There are four possible paths in the game, but unlike the previous games, they are not decided by the alignment system. Instead, right in the beginning of the game the player must choose one of the four main characters as a companion to investigate the misterious events and the Makai. Each main character has a defined path and once one has been chosen, the player is locked on that path. Yumi, Reiko and Charlie visit the worlds based off the deadly sins (Yumi and Reiko visit the same worlds, Charlie visits a few different ones), while Akira puts the player in an entirely different setting. Akira's path is much more difficult and, instead of being segmented among worlds, is composed by just one huge tower very similar to Persona 3's Tartarus. This path focuses much more heavily on the 'Dungeon Crawler' aspect of the game.Each of the worlds raise a few philosophical questions about the nature and consequences of the deadly sins, but the game presents these conflicts in a non-theological manner.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"21146","CommunityRating":"3.1666666666666665","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Atlus","Publisher":"Atlus"},"Shin Momotarou Densetsu":{"Name":"Shin Momotarou Densetsu","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-24T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"The game's story continues where the previous game, 1990's Momotarou Densetsu II for the PC Engine, leaves off.

Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.

These include exhibition mode, playoff mode, and an Olympic mode that is loosely based on the 1994 Winter Olympics. The object of the Olympic mode is to simply win the gold medal while the defeated team receives a silver medal. In order to qualify for the gold medal game, he or she must rank in the top four in either \"League A\" or \"League B\" during the round-robin format; an X refers to a win while an O refers to a defeat. Achieving this will promote the player's team to a playoff of eight teams that will determine the gold and silver medal recipients. Teams that belong to opposite leagues eventually get to play against each other in the playoff mode.\n\nPeriods can either last for one minute, two minutes (60 seconds) or three minutes long (120 seconds). Referees can be set to either real (similar to real international hockey), normal (similar to the NHL), or free (involving a visually challenged referee who only calls for icing). In the real mode, penalties are given for every body check while most body checking is allowed in normal. However, both participants that are involved in a fighting situation are penalized in both normal and real mode. This is offset by using extremely short durations in the penalty box due to the unrealistically low period durations.","MaxPlayers":"4","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"122624","CommunityRating":"3","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Ice_Hockey","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"19","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Opera House","Publisher":"Sunsoft"},"Super Indy Champ":{"Name":"Super Indy Champ","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Super Indy Champ is a Racing game, developed by Open System and published by Forum, which was released in Japan in 1994.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"26309","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"Open System","Publisher":"Forum"},"Super International Cricket":{"Name":"Super International Cricket","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"From the crack of the cricket bat to cheering crowds, this game has it all - even seagulls!

Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.\n\nThe most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color.

The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks — that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then — and sucking potions — that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid — from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.\n\nBefore reaching the format of a common Super Famicom cartridge, the game was released for and downloadable by the console's add-on Satellaview in four versions. Given data size limitations, only one of the four of those, released for use with the Nintendo Power cartridge, could include all the levels designed by game creators: that is the one released as a Super Famicom standard cartridge later, and on Wii's Virtual console eventually.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"24817","CommunityRating":"4","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Indies Zero","Publisher":"Nintendo"},"Suzuka 8 Hours":{"Name":"Suzuka 8 Hours","ReleaseDate":"1994-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Ride Hard!

Normally, such a track cannot be done on the SNES, as all assets for a single song must fit into the 64kB audio buffer before the song can be played. This technical limit was overcome by slicing the vocal track into small samples and swapping them in and out of the audio buffer. The rest of the intro theme is standard MIDI.\n\n\"Tales of Phantasia\" presents a unique combat system. The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQNghU4xGIU","DatabaseID":"6232","CommunityRating":"4.325","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Phantasia","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","CommunityRatingCount":"20","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Namco"},"Tamagotchi Town":{"Name":"Tamagotchi Town","ReleaseDate":"1999-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The goal of the game is to create a large Tamagotchi society on a given piece of land containing different landscapes.The game features a unique way of raising Tamagotchis through interactivity with their environment.

The game was actually a sequel to the Manfred Trentz game, Turrican, but the character sprite was changed so that it could be rebranded as a movie tie-in. A rom of what appears to be the complete version of this game exists. The enemies and gameplay closely match Turrican, as to be expected. It is unknown why this game was canceled. Genesis and Game Boy versions of this game were released, and Turrican 2 was released on various computer platforms. Nintendo Power commented in the October 1992 issue that it was similar to Contra, but complained about the poor controls.\nThe game was originally developed using the original C64 source code and Amiga graphics as a base. At a late stage in the development, Accolade also acquired rights to produce a game spin-off of the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Universal Soldier and decided to rebrand the game as Universal Soldier. Turrican's sprite was changed into a marine and several other substitutions were made. Amongst other changes, the eyeballs-walking-on-fingers became mini tanks, and instead of a large mech/steel dragon in the first stage, the player now faces a large representation of Dolph Lundgren's character in the film.\nThe three shoot 'em up stages, cut out from the port, were replaced by the developers with three original stages (a Vietnam jungle, a fortress, and a motel/car junkyard) that in theory should link the game to the film's atmosphere. The rest of the original Turrican II stages are still present and remain mostly intact in overall design, though some of them appear in different order, along with the three new levels differently scattered through them.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"113075","CommunityRating":"3.5","Platform":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","CommunityRatingCount":"29","Genres":"Action","Developer":"The Code Monkeys","Publisher":"Accolade"},"Urban Strike":{"Name":"Urban Strike","ReleaseDate":"1995-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Home field advantage!
