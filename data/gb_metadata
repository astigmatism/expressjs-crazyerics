The game also features a password system and four different difficulty levels.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J0aHRo69IM","DatabaseID":"18289","CommunityRating":"3.5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Tater","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Atlus","Publisher":"Atlus"},"America Oudan Ultra Quiz":{"Name":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz is a Trivia game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1990.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"125777","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Quiz","Developer":"TOMY","Publisher":"Tomy"},"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 2":{"Name":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 2","ReleaseDate":"1991-12-20T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 2 is a Trivia game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1991.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"125786","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Quiz","Developer":"TOMY","Publisher":"Tomy"},"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 3":{"Name":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 3 - Champion Taikai","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"America Oudan Ultra-Quiz Part 3 is a Miscellaneous game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1992.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF_NuOH298Y","DatabaseID":"125787","CommunityRating":"3","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Quiz","Developer":"TOMY","Publisher":"Tomy"},"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 4":{"Name":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 4","ReleaseDate":"1993-10-29T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"America Oudan Ultra Quiz Part 4 is a Trivia game, published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1993.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"125788","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Quiz","Developer":"TOMY","Publisher":"Tomy"},"Amida":{"Name":"Amida","ReleaseDate":"1990-10-23T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Amida is a Japanese ladder climbing puzzle video game.

You then fight each of the other five teams once per round in a short dodgeball game, two-on-two. Unlike normal dodgeball, you are not knocked out with a single hit. Rather, in Battle Dodge Ball, each character has a specific amount of HP. Once he takes enough hits to lose all his HP, he is out of the match.\n\nAlong with HP, this trends into a general statistics system with several other stats. If you win a match, you gain a variable amount of experience points, and 15 experience points if you lose a match. You can level up your stats and make each match significantly easier over time.\n\nYour team has two players each. The Leader has the ability to make special attacks, and is generally more powerful. The follower, however, has two 'forms' or copies or whatever - an infielder who plays on the main arena, and an outfielder who stands on the lines behind the enemy side of the arena and can catch long passes and grab balls that enemies dodge. The outfielder can also return balls to you, but also throw it at the enemy players, making him potentially dangerous. Stats for the outfielder are upgraded separately from his infield counterpart.\n\nOnce you play a full 10 rounds against each of the five opposing teams, the game ends.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7448ZIw5dlU","DatabaseID":"119036","CommunityRating":"5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Sun L","Publisher":"Banpresto"},"Battle Pingpong":{"Name":"Battle Pingpong","ReleaseDate":"1990-08-31T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"In Battle Ping Pong the player can battle against ten AI enemies in a table tennis game.

It was one of the first Sailor Moon-related video games to be released.\n\nIn this game, the player controlled Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon. The storyline was based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).\n\nThe three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.\n\nBy default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the \"down\" button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc.\nThe bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG_nU-wfw2w","DatabaseID":"18784","CommunityRating":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"Arc System Works","Publisher":"Bandai"},"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R":{"Name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R","ReleaseDate":"1994-04-22T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Sailor Moon R was a video game released for the Nintendo Game Boy by Angel Studios in 1994.\n\nIn this game, the player could play using \"story mode\" or \"arcade mode.\" In story mode, the player began play with Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon, then Chibiusa, then the Inner Senshi. Gameplay alternated between a story chapter where the player walked around the map and talked to other characters, followed by a platform level, and a boss room. In arcade mode, the player chose a character, and the non-combat parts of the game are skipped.\n\nIn both modes, the game was complete after five stages, most of which were rather short. The boss rooms sometimes started with a scene with Tuxedo Mask where the player would receive an extra life for picking up the rose item. Other items the player could pick up included hearts, which refilled some health, cake slices, which refilled more health, and a tiara, which offered a power-up to the character's attacks.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"18785","CommunityRating":"3.5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"Angel Studios","Publisher":"Nintendo"},"Black Bass - Lure Fishing":{"Name":"Black Bass: Lure Fishing","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"FISH ANYWHERE.

Each level is composed of a number of tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or angular) on it - except one which is just a black hole.

To ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"119038","CommunityRating":"3.5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Tonkin House","Publisher":"Tonkin House"},"Blues Brothers, The":{"Name":"The Blues Brothers","ReleaseDate":"1992-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Cruise along with Jake and Elwood, those all-time rhythm'n'blues men in this engrossing platform game - an explosive mix of adventure, comedy and music.\n\nBack by popular demand, the Blues Brothers are out to conquer the stage one more time.

Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.\n\nGrabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to \"bonk\" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.\n\nThe game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"18323","CommunityRating":"1.1111111111111112","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonk's_Revenge","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","CommunityRatingCount":"9","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Red Company","Publisher":"Hudson Soft"},"Booby Boys":{"Name":"Booby Boys","ReleaseDate":"1993-06-25T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Gameplay in Booby Boys is very simple.

This time out, the duo's exploits take them to the Royal Castle of Blobolonia, Blob's home planet, as they attempt to free the lovely-and imprisoned-Princess Blobette from the clutches of the treacherous Antagonistic Alchemist.\n\nJoin our heroes as they encounter secret rooms, clever traps, and dangerous obstacles in the labyrinthine depths of the castle. But all is not lost-these two share a very special secret: With each flavor of jelly bean the boy feeds Blob, Blob will magically transform into a different shape that can help this intrepid pair get past just about anything the Alchemist can conjure up!\n\nThe Rescue of Princess Blobette tells the story of a young, male protagonist and his blob companion as they attempt to rescue the latter's girlfriend, the titular Princess Blobette. The damsel in distress has been imprisoned by the Antagonistic Alchemist within the highest tower of the Royal Castle on the planet Blobolinia. Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_cxzFoT7ck","DatabaseID":"18333","CommunityRating":"3","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rescue_of_Princess_Blobette","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"5","Genres":"Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Imagineering","Publisher":"Absolute Entertainment"},"Brain Drain":{"Name":"Brain Drain","ReleaseDate":"1998-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Think you are smart?

Every maze has monsters patrolling the depths of the labyrinth. Help Catgirl and Catboy push around huge blocks to bridge a path to yet another maze, or topple a block a few stories over the pursuing monsters. If you make a mistake, simply use the rewind function and travel back in time to correct it. With 100 mazes in this labyrinth, it will be quite a challenge to get out of the curse's reach!\n\nCatrap is more than just a game of mindbending intrigue and action. Be the architect of the underground labyrinth and make your own games of intricate puzzles.\n\nWhether you choose to be a maze builder or a maze solver, we know you can help Catboy and Catgirl land on their feet.\n\nCatrap (known as Pitman in Japan) is a puzzle game in which the player maneuvers the player, an anthropomorphic cat, to navigate a room while clearing obstacles and kicking monsters and ghosts off the screen. Once the player has knocked all of the enemies off the screen, he advances to the next level. Advancement can prove difficult for the player as increasingly intricate obstacles are presented to overcome all of the monsters and ghosts. Arguably, the easiest route to solve the problem is through trial and error. A player may try one combination of maneuvers by moving the obstacle in one direction, then he may find himself trapped. The player can hit the 'A'-button to reverse his movements and try again in a different way until he finds the solution that enables him to access all of the baddies to knock them off the screen. Trial and error seems to make up a large portion of the game. Players can also create their own mazes. The game is credited with having originated the time-rewind mechanic.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO-ig99eLXY","DatabaseID":"18585","CommunityRating":"3.6666666666666665","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitman_(video_game)","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"6","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"ASK Kodansha","Publisher":"Asmik"},"Cave Noire":{"Name":"Cave Noire","ReleaseDate":"1991-04-19T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"You have come to the northern village Karuzu.

It will take the art of Daedalus and the power of your mind to solve the confounding riddles of the blocks. To be beaten is ordinary, to achieve victory is an art.\n\nThe game is essentially a series of 36 jigsaw puzzles with Tetris-like pieces known as pentominos that must be assembled into a specific shape. The puzzles start off with rectangular shapes and simple solutions, but the puzzles quickly grow more complex, with odder shapes like a rocket ship, a gun, and even enlarged versions of some of the pentominoes themselves. Each level is timed, and once the timer is started it cannot be stopped until the level is finished. One starts off the game with only three pentomino pieces, and at the completion of each early level, a new piece is awarded to the player. At the final level, the player is given the 2x2 square O tetromino and must complete an 8x8 square puzzle.\n\nAfter completing each level, the player was given a password to access that level at a later time. Interestingly, each password was a common English four-letter word, so that by guessing common four-letter words, players could potentially access levels they had not actually reached by playing the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcSCwySKcQg","DatabaseID":"18611","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalian_Opus","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Vic Tokai","Publisher":"Vic Tokai"},"Daffy Duck - The Marvin Missions":{"Name":"Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-30T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"YOU MUST BE DAFFY TO PLAY THIS!\n\nDaffy Duck becomes legendary space hero Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a 1/2 Century once again to match wits and lasers with his old nemesis Marvin the Martian!

It seemed that all the filth of the city had crawled out from beneath some slimy rock...the Brow, Pruneface, Flattop, and the rest of their ruthless cohorts were on the rampage again. But worst of all, that dirty dealing Big Boy had kidnapped Tess Trueheart!! Suddenly Tracy's two-way wrist radio broke the silence. \"Calling Dick Tracy! Calling Dick Tracy!\" He sprang from behind his desk and burst through the squad room door shouting, \"O.K. boys, let's go! This could be our lucky break!\"\n\nThe game's introduction shows that Big Boy has escaped from the state penitentiary and kidnapped Tess, Tracy's love interest. The gameplay itself is purely level-based platforming, foregoing the overhead driving sequences of its NES counterpart.\n\nStylistically, the Game Boy version bears a strong resemblance to the side-scrolling mode of the NES version. Dick Tracy can punch and use the same weapons (hand gun, Tommy gun, tear gas), as well as grenades (which will instantly kill all non-boss enemies on the screen). This game also shares some common music with the NES version. Each of the five levels contains 12 hidden pieces of a photograph used to solve a puzzle at the end of each level.\n\nAt the end of each level, Dick Tracy would fight one of the antagonists from the film, including Shoulders, Flattop, and Pruneface). After defeating the boss, the player would need to solve the twelve-piece puzzle using the pieces found throughout the level to reveal a photo of the next boss to be pursued. If the puzzle could be solved within the allotted period of time, the player would be awarded a bonus life. For every two pieces placed correctly, the player would be awarded with one extra hit point. If any of the missing pieces were missed or if the puzzle isn't solved in time, then the game will automatically piece the whole image together (without any bonuses, of course). Then, Tracy would interrogate the fallen boss for where to search next for clues leading to Big Boy and Tess.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRknxeYTP8M","DatabaseID":"18618","CommunityRating":"3.125","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Tracy_(video_game)","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Realtime Associates","Publisher":"Bandai"},"Dig Dug":{"Name":"Dig Dug","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"DIG DUG WILL PUMP YOU UP\n\nDig Dug is on duty keeping the garden growing.

The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and \"bump\" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.\n\n\n\nThe player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bCeBsdjEr0","DatabaseID":"119041","CommunityRating":"1","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Slayer_(video_game)","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Epoch Co.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom Corp"},"Dragon's Lair - The Legend":{"Name":"Dragon's Lair: The Legend","ReleaseDate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Dirk the Daring held the maids limp and lifeless body gently in his arms, as he surveyed the carnage of the bloody battle scene.

Your main weapon is the ability to dig both to the left and right of your character. The holes you dig are only temporary and fill themselves in.

Besides bricks and ladders, levels also consist of blocks (which can't be dug into), rope (to traverse platform chasms) and crumbling bricks (which you fall through).

Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game.

The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.\n\nWhile the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action.

However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.\n\nThe game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PqHNzpKITA","DatabaseID":"21688","CommunityRating":"2.5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Attack","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco"},"Pac-Man":{"Name":"Pac-Man","ReleaseDate":"1991-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Gobble, gobble, gulp!

You can even substitute second-stringers for the \"skill\" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.\n\nPlay perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.\n\nGames are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout \"First Down!\" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.

To do this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until there are no tiles stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each other, which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, it can only move a single tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a stack of two tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the stack onto the single tile in order to create a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance greater than one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a lot of planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles pioneered by Sokoban.\n\nLater stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, be eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for three-dimensional – or even four-dimensional – thinking on behalf of the player. None of the special tiles must be left on the screen for the stage to be cleared.\n\nA second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a limited amount of time. An editing mode will also allow the player to create levels of his own.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"21706","CommunityRating":"1.0625","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","CommunityRatingCount":"8","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"SETA Corporation","Publisher":"SETA Corporation"},"Q-bert II":{"Name":"Q*bert for Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"1992-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Hop Q*bert up and down the steps of a \"three-dimensional\" pyramid, changing each step's color as he lands.

A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.\n\nThough the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased.

Unlike other games of the genre, the players can never jump, but have to use ladders. They can conjure one custom ladder above or below them in order to go to the appropriate platform. There can be only one such 'custom' ladder; therefore if the fairy summons it again, it will disappear from its previous position in order to appear again next to the fairy. This can be beneficial for the player, if a monster is climbing that ladder to approach her.\n\nThe fairies' quest is to rescue their mother, trapped in a tower.

However, plugging the cart into a Super Game Boy allows playing the game in all four cabinet types of the SNES version.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"21237","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Developer":"Taito Corporation","Publisher":"Nintendo of America Inc."},"Spanky's Quest":{"Name":"Spanky's Quest","ReleaseDate":"1992-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Spanky's Quest is an Action game, developed and published by Natsume, which was released in Japan in 1991.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"21735","CommunityRating":"4.5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Natsume","Publisher":"Natsume"},"Speedball 2 - Brutal Deluxe":{"Name":"Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe","ReleaseDate":"1992-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is a Sports game, developed by Spidersoft and published by Mindscape Inc., which was released in 1992.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"21736","CommunityRating":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"Spidersoft","Publisher":"Mindscape"},"Speedy Gonzales":{"Name":"Speedy Gonzales","ReleaseDate":"1993-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Speedy Gonzales is an Action game, developed by Citizen Software and published by SunSoft, which was released in 1993.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"21737","CommunityRating":"2.3461538461538463","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","CommunityRatingCount":"13","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Citizen Software","Publisher":"Sunsoft"},"Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade's Revenge":{"Name":"Spider-Man & X-Men: Arcade's Revenge","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Spider-Man and his mutant pals need your help to escape from Arcade's diabolical amusement park - battling killer clowns, hungry piranhas, lethal doom balls and deadly robot replicas of super-villains like Carnage and Juggernaut!

The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.\n\nOn away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.\n\nFinally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.\n\nThe second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"21742","CommunityRating":"4.333333333333333","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Generations:_Beyond_the_Nexus","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Imagineering Inc","Publisher":"Absolute Entertainment"},"Star Trek - The Next Generation":{"Name":"Star Trek: The Next Generation","ReleaseDate":"1993-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Star Trek: The Next Generation is a Simulation game, developed by Imagineering Inc and published by Absolute Entertainment, which was released in 1993.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"21743","CommunityRating":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Imagineering Inc","Publisher":"Absolute Entertainment"},"Star Wars":{"Name":"Star Wars","ReleaseDate":"1992-06-30T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away... a small, courageous group of rebels are fighting to restore freedom in the galaxy.

In the game, players race remote control cars on a series of tracks. It can be played solo, with two-players via the Game Link Cable, or with three or four players via the Four Player Adapter. The game features 24 different tracks of increasing difficulty, and the object is to finish in the top three in order to qualify to race in the next track. Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining.\nEach track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and \"slow cones\" that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: \"zippers\" (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars.

Its Batman games were almost all excellent, especially the Game Boy release, which combined Mario-style platforms and blockbusting with gunplay. Much of Sunsoft's NES catalogue is also fondly remembered, with titles such as Blaster Master, Journey to Silius and, despite its obscene difficulty, Mr. Gimmick / Gimmick! to name a few. Trip World for the Game Boy is another Sunsoft goodie, regularly featuring on lists for obscure or overlooked games and, in the US at least, lists for import exclusives. Released only in Japan and Europe in small quantities, a boxed copy of the original cartridge now sells for ludicrously high prices. At the time of writing, two unboxed copies were on eBay for around £115 / $180; Yahoo! Auctions Japan had nothing.\n\nTrip World at first appears to be like any conventional platformer – perhaps a little too conventional. There's an intro showing the Maita Flower from atop Mount Dubious being stolen from an elderly Shabubu who is also kidnapped (a bunny-like creature not to be confused with the culinary shabu-shabu dish). Cue the old creature's grandson, Yacopu, to venture out, save his grandfather and retrieve the flower, thereby bringing peace back to the world. Players move across the screen, avoiding spike pits, jumping along collapsing platforms, and karate kicking enemies... Except the enemies don't seem to fight back. Very few of them in fact cause any damage at all, with only the bosses posing a genuine threat. Apart from the harmless enemies, it's all very standard. Yacopu can collect fruit items which imbue him with special powers: the ability to fire paralysing seeds that sprout from the skulls of enemies; a bouncy ball power-up; and a third which allows him to attack with his tail. These powers are timed and soon wear off, but in some stages it's possible to collect an additional power-up which, when combined with the first, grants something entirely new. The best of which causes Yacopu to sprout legs and gain the ability to fire instant-death projectiles.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"23366","CommunityRating":"3.9444444444444446","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"9","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Sunsoft","Publisher":"Sunsoft"},"True Lies":{"Name":"True Lies","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"It's not like he's saving the world or anything.

The player controls the VIXIV to complete various missions assigned by the Training Academy Coach. Objectives can range from destroying enemy targets, escorting cargo, or defending bases. A short break is provided after the completion of each mission, and the player is awarded a number of stars based on their skill in each level. 10 small stars equal one regular star, and a certain number of stars are needed to continue the game after failing a mission.

Its protagonist is Zool, a gremlin \"Ninja of the Nth Dimension\" who is forced to land on Earth; in order to gain ninja ranking, he has to pass seven lands, beating a boss at the end of each of them. The game contains a number of embedded minigames, including several arcade games, a scrolling space shooter and a game accessible only by making Zool play a certain tune on an in-game piano or finding certain invisible warp points.\n\nDevelopment and release\n-------------------------------------\nZool was intended as a rival to Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. George Allen came with the idea of Zool as he was criticized on his previous game Switchblade II for having a lack of enemies. In development, Zool could cast spells to get him out of trouble by collecting potions. For example, Zool could escape from pits with high jump spells and cast a shadow spell to make a clone of him that follows his actions (thus doubling the fire power). In the final version, the spells were replaced with collectible powerups. The very early name for the project was Pootz. The soundtrack by Patrick Phelan overlaps with the Lotus 3 soundtrack and inspired several modern electro/techno remixes. The game was heavily hyped upon its initial release, including being bundled with the newly launched Amiga 1200, although not the AGA version with enhanced graphics which followed later. In 2000, the Amiga version of Zool was re-released as part of The Best of Gremlin compilation.\n\nZool was also ported to the Atari ST, Game Boy, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, SNES, Master System, Sega Game Gear, Amiga CD32, PC, and RISC OS platform, as well as for the arcade machines. The Amiga CD32 version has original red book audio tracks by Neil Biggin and has the option to have both sound effects and music. This and the Acorn Archimedes port are the only two incarnations of the original Amiga version to have this. Most computer ports are close to the Amiga original but the Genesis and SNES ports are very different with different levels which are smaller (likely due to shortage of RAM), different graphics and bosses. The SNES port is also very buggy with a low horizontal resolution, which makes it easier to run into enemies and being overall a slower game.\n\nTwo young adult novels book based on the games, entitled Cool Zool and Zool Rules, were released in February 1995.
