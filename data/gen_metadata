Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.\n\nBubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak's back.\n\nIn between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections taking place underwater – completing these earns bonuses.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3887","CommunityRating":"4.2692307692307692","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_and_Squeak_(video_game)","Platform":"Sega Genesis","CommunityRatingCount":"13","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Fox Williams","Publisher":"Sunsoft"},"Bubsy II":{"Name":"Bubsy II","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"A new historical theme park, the Amazotarium, has been made.

He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm.

As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.\nShao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn.

It is the sixth installment of the NHL series and the first to be released on both PlayStation and Saturn.\n\n\nNHL 97 took the graphics even further ahead, using a full 3D engine, with motion captured polygonal players (PC/PlayStation/Saturn versions only, the Mega Drive and SNES versions retained similar graphical values to previous games, but with further enhanced animations). Each goaltender has his own custom-painted mask and the original artwork can be seen inside the game with a special \"Goalie Mask Viewer\". NHL 97 also introduces play-by-play commentary, provided by well-known announcer Jim Hughson.\n\nFor the first time since EA Hockey, national teams were added, but only Canada, the United States, and Russia have their own teams while the other two are selections of the best European players. NHL 97 introduced a skills competition, allowing the user to pick players to compete in drills such as hardest shot, goalie 2 on 0, and accuracy shooting, among others.\n\nThis was the first year of the \"Third Jersey.\" Teams that had available third jerseys for NHL 97 were, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Boston Bruins, Los Angeles Kings, Pittsburgh Penguins & Vancouver Canucks. These were the first teams to try out the third jersey. To activate the alternate uniform left click on the teams banner in the controller setup.\n\nIn addition, each team in the game had one player with a special skill. Examples are Joe Sakic's (Colorado Avalanche) \"wrong-footed wrist shot\" and Rob Ray's (Buffalo Sabres) ability to check an opposing player while still controlling the puck. A major flaw in the game was the glitch that allowed players to score 100% of the time when shooting down by taking a shot against the boards at the hash marks of the left circle in the bottom zone.\n\nAlong with the PC, Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES versions, both the Sega Saturn and PlayStation version made their debut, although they were rushed and buggy. For instance, the shot speed in the PlayStation and Saturn versions was so slow that some skaters could beat a slapshot down the ice.

The game would have tried to build on the concept of the original arcade game, but feels to some degree more like a very bad approach to the Streets of Rage school of beat-em-ups.

The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. Also, as the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point he is given a position in his future life, from beggar to King's adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"969","CommunityRating":"3.4285714285714284","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Strategy","Developer":"MicroProse","Publisher":"MicroProse"},"Pocahontas":{"Name":"Pocahontas","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"Incarnation of the Disney cartoon; Pocahontas, along with a tag team partner in her raccoon friend, Meeko, goes about her homeland, helping her animal friends.

The SNES version is credited to DVS Electronic Co., while the Mega Drive iteration seems to be developed by ex-workers from Chuanpu and published by X Boy. The game appears to have been released in 2000, as hinted by details on the box art.\n\nLike the Famicom pirate, the player controls Pikachu through numerous sidescrolling levels. There are 5 levels in total, with a boss at the end of each, as well a mini-boss in the first level of the Mega Drive version. Pikachu can jump on enemies and use a special move which clears all of the enemies on the screen, although the latter can only be done when the charge meter is full (indicated by a power bar at the top of the screen of the SNES version, or a numeric counter in the Mega Drive version, which is full when it hits 20.) The player can start either 3 and 5 lives and continues each, and there's a difficulty setting in the options menu. A sequel to this game was made for the Mega Drive, Pocket Monster II. The ending is an image of some Pikachus.\nThe graphics are ripped from numerous sources. The backgrounds are ripped from numerous Mega Drive games, including Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster's Hidden Treasure, Mr. Nutz, Quackshot, Magical Taruruuto-kun and Monster World IV. The graphics from the latter aren't present in the SNES version. The level graphics of the fourth and the last stage of the SNES version was ripped from Skyblazer. Some of the enemy sprites are ripped from Syd of Valis, and one of the enemy sprites appears to be taken from Super Metroid. The intro, as well as several other graphics are taken from the Pokémon anime.\n\nThe music in the Mega Drive version seems to be mostly original, although the opening theme is based on the Goten vs. Trunks theme of Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden 3 (also used in the bootleg Dragon Ball: Final Bout), and there is music from Shui Hu Feng Yun Zhuan (2nd stage, bosses and last stage, also used in Mortal Combat 5) and Hercules 2 (3rd stage). Strangely, in the Mega Drive version, Pikachu constantly says his name on the title screen, when hit and upon losing a life while he's mute in the SNES game. This is probably because the SNES version's audio is an unedited rip from the game Bonkers and it might've been too difficult to do digitized audio on the system.\n\nDifferences Between Mega Drive/Genesis And SNES Versions \nThe Mega Drive version doesn't credit any company to making it, while the SNES version claims to be made by DVS Electronic Co.\nThe music is completely different in both games, with the Mega Drive version having a mix of original music and music from Shui Hu Feng Yun Zhuan and Hercules 2, while the SNES version takes the music from Bonkers.\nThe sound effects are also different in the two games, although with both they're in PCM format. One of them in the Mega Drive version is taken from Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.\nThe \"Pikachu\" sound effect isn't present in the SNES version, but is replaced with a \"Yow!\" sound clip from Bonkers.\nThere are numerous minor graphical differences between the two versions.\nThe Mega Drive version is set to Normal difficulty by default, while the SNES version is set to Easy.\nThe mini-boss in the first level isn't in the SNES version.\nMany of the bosses in the SNES version are smaller and follow a set movement pattern.\nThe fourth and fifth levels are completely different, aside from boss of level four.\nIn the ending, the background scrolls in the Mega Drive version while there's an ending message in the SNES version.\nIn the Mega Drive version, Pikachu can jump in mid-air before he falls down after touching an enemy. This is also present in Pocket Monster II.\nIn the Mega Drive version, you fight Onix as the final boss. In the SNES version, you fight recolors of the previous bosses with A.I. differences.\nThe boxart of the Mega Drive version features a picture of Pikachu traced from the cover of a Japan-exclusive N64 title Hey You, Pikachu! as well as several logos such as \"New Game\" and \"2000\", all covering the cover art of another N64 exclusive, Pokemon Stadium 2, as well as the original Nintendo and N64 logos. One half of the game's logo also comes from Hey You, Pikachu!, making its' title half-Chinese and half-Japanese; in its' entirety, it reads as 皮卡丘 げんきでちゅう (Píkǎqiū Gen Ki De Chu).\n\nTrivia \nThe box of the SNES version from DVS Electronic uses the same image of Pikachu and the smaller \"Pocket Monsters\" logo also found on the Pocket Monster Go! Go variation of Monster Go! Go! Go!!.\nThis bootleg became somewhat popular due to a JonTron YouTube video.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"141475","WikipediaURL":"http://bootleggames.wikia.com/wiki/Pocket_Monster_(Mega_Drive/SNES)","Platform":"Sega Genesis","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Chuanpu Technology","Publisher":"X-Boy"},"Pocket Monsters 2":{"Name":"Pocket Monsters 2","Overview":"Pocket Monster II is a platform game for the Sega Mega Drive and it's the direct sequel to Pocket Monster, both probably developed by ex-workers from Chuanpu Technology and perhaps published by X Boy. Unlike the first game, no SNES port has yet been discovered.\nThis game shows a significant improvement over the original, as both the artwork and audio has been improved since the first game, though the former is still mostly stolen from other games and it still shows all the previous glitches, in addition to a new one. The music is mostly remade from the Japanese Pokémon TV series, with songs including the original Japanese opening theme (Stage 1 and Stage 4) and the ending theme of the pilot. (Boss theme.)\n\nControls\nRather simple, you move with the control pad and jump with the 'C' button. Unlike in Pocket Monster, Pikachu cannot use a screen-wide electric attack.  Instead, he can toss Pokéballs with the 'B' button (when they are collected). You can kill enemies with them, but are rather useless thanks to their lacking range and the fact that you drop all of your Pokéballs when you get hit.\nSummary\nThis game is incredibly short overall, as it only contains four levels with a sole final boss at the final one.  However, the length of the game comes in punishing slightly careless actions with a very large amount of leaps of faith and overall blind jumps, in combination with the lack of checkpoints. Also, despite the game has very few stages, they're incredibly long, so all of this makes the game aggravating at times.\nThe four levels are also incredibly generic. They have no names, but their themes are the following: forest, canyon/valley, castle, and power plant. The only one of the four levels with a specific mechanic is the third, with a button-activated door.\n\nAs mentioned before, the game punishes any mistake you make.  Falling down is almost a guarantee if you don't have the map completely memorized.  However, the plentiful extra life pickups, which regenerate upon death, keep you from getting a Game Over too soon.\n\nGlitches\nIt's no surprise that this has more than a couple of glitches...\nPikachu can only control the height of his jump while standing perfectly still, making it incredibly difficult to dodge certain enemies while progressing through the stage.\nOn that same note, Pikachu can jump down from vertically moving platforms (moving up) if he jumps too low.\nThe moving platforms can sometimes disappear if they are by the edge of the screen, due to objects being programmed to disappear if they scroll off screen.\nThere's an odd glitch that causes random hits on pokemon due to iffy hit detection.  This is common in other bootleg games.\nUsing a certain variation of this glitch, you can defeat the final boss easily.\nPikachu can jump again after jumping on a Pokémon.  (Also applies to whenever Pikachu is damaged)\nWhen a Pokéball is tossed and on-screen, it moves as Pikachu does.\nSometimes, when you throw a Pokéball to an enemy, the game freezes. It seems to happen both in emulators and in real hardware.\nTrivia \nSome music tracks from this game were reused in Fengkuang Dafuweng (aka Crazy Richman/Crazy Monopoly) by Vast Fame.\nThe level graphics from level 2 seem to be taken from Mega Man X's (SNES) Sting Chameleon stage.\nThe level graphics from level 3 are taken from Pink Goes To Hollywood\nThe level graphics from level 4 are taken from Sparkster on the SNES and some of the enemies are taken from a variety of Megadrive games including Mega Bomberman and Magical Taruruuto-kun (the latter, fittingly, was developed by Game Freak, the creators of Pokémon.) \nThe crab and the blue monkey from the first level were stolen from a original licenced Sega Genesis game Wonder Boy in Monster World by Westone.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"141495","Platform":"Sega Genesis","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{}},"Populous":{"Name":"Populous","ReleaseDate":"1989-06-05T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Now it's your chance to play God!

That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly.
