The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.\n\nOccasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.\n\nLike Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.\n\nSome ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. \"Flash columns\" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. \"Doubles\" allows two players work together in the same well. \"Time trial\" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"465","CommunityRating":"3.9705882352941178","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"17","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Sega","Publisher":"Sega"},"Columns III - Revenge of Columns":{"Name":"Columns III","ReleaseDate":"1993-12-17T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Third game in the Columns series.

The stories appear to be identical: during the Tang Dynasty, the Hun warlord Tan-Yu led his soldiers to seize the dynasty, and Tang conscripts all men to fight the oncoming forces. Hua Mulan, not wanting to see her old father fight, goes in to fight for him.\n\nThe game is a typical platformer.

It was released on October 31, 1996 and was the successor to NHL 96. It is the sixth installment of the NHL series and the first to be released on both PlayStation and Saturn.\n\n\nNHL 97 took the graphics even further ahead, using a full 3D engine, with motion captured polygonal players (PC/PlayStation/Saturn versions only, the Mega Drive and SNES versions retained similar graphical values to previous games, but with further enhanced animations). Each goaltender has his own custom-painted mask and the original artwork can be seen inside the game with a special \"Goalie Mask Viewer\". NHL 97 also introduces play-by-play commentary, provided by well-known announcer Jim Hughson.\n\nFor the first time since EA Hockey, national teams were added, but only Canada, the United States, and Russia have their own teams while the other two are selections of the best European players. NHL 97 introduced a skills competition, allowing the user to pick players to compete in drills such as hardest shot, goalie 2 on 0, and accuracy shooting, among others.\n\nThis was the first year of the \"Third Jersey.\" Teams that had available third jerseys for NHL 97 were, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Boston Bruins, Los Angeles Kings, Pittsburgh Penguins & Vancouver Canucks. These were the first teams to try out the third jersey. To activate the alternate uniform left click on the teams banner in the controller setup.\n\nIn addition, each team in the game had one player with a special skill. Examples are Joe Sakic's (Colorado Avalanche) \"wrong-footed wrist shot\" and Rob Ray's (Buffalo Sabres) ability to check an opposing player while still controlling the puck. A major flaw in the game was the glitch that allowed players to score 100% of the time when shooting down by taking a shot against the boards at the hash marks of the left circle in the bottom zone.\n\nAlong with the PC, Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES versions, both the Sega Saturn and PlayStation version made their debut, although they were rushed and buggy. For instance, the shot speed in the PlayStation and Saturn versions was so slow that some skaters could beat a slapshot down the ice.

The player cannot control Pac-Man directly, but instead can direct his attention in various directions, and is armed with a slingshot that can be used to strike certain objects, including Pac-Man himself.\nPac-Man's mood varies throughout the game, usually in response to his environment or the player's actions, and generally his mood affects his actions and his willingness to cooperate with the player; the varieties of \"bad\" moods can at time compromise the player's ability to progress. There are a few instances, however, where Pac Man is required to be angry. Hitting objects with the slingshot can often get Pac-Man to look at that object and piece together parts of the puzzle he is currently trying to solve - for example, hitting a door may cause Pac-Man to go inside a house to discover a clue. But beware - a few objects when hit can also produce disastrous (and humorous) results. Hitting a trash can on a city street at the wrong time, for example, can cause a cat to jump out and attack Pac-Man.\nThroughout the game, Pac-Man is occasionally harassed by the four ghosts from the classic Pac-Man games. When this happens, Pac-Man is paralyzed by fear and eventually faints, unless the player gives him a power pellet. Then Pac-Man becomes Super Pac-Man for a brief time and flies around, eating the ghosts. In some cases, the ghosts may leave behind important objects.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"674","CommunityRating":"2.7857142857142856","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_2:_The_New_Adventures","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Adventure; Puzzle","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco"},"Pac-Mania":{"Name":"Pac-Mania","ReleaseDate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man.

The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"4546","CommunityRating":"3.9166666666666665","Platform":"Sega Genesis","CommunityRatingCount":"6","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Tengen"},"Pachinko Canyon":{"Name":"Pachinko Kuunyan","ReleaseDate":"1992-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Pachinko Kuunyan (パチンコクーニャン) is a 1992 pachinko game for the Sega Mega Drive by Soft Vision released exclusively in Japan.

The SNES version is credited to DVS Electronic Co., while the Mega Drive iteration seems to be developed by ex-workers from Chuanpu and published by X Boy. The game appears to have been released in 2000, as hinted by details on the box art.\n\nLike the Famicom pirate, the player controls Pikachu through numerous sidescrolling levels. There are 5 levels in total, with a boss at the end of each, as well a mini-boss in the first level of the Mega Drive version. Pikachu can jump on enemies and use a special move which clears all of the enemies on the screen, although the latter can only be done when the charge meter is full (indicated by a power bar at the top of the screen of the SNES version, or a numeric counter in the Mega Drive version, which is full when it hits 20.) The player can start either 3 and 5 lives and continues each, and there's a difficulty setting in the options menu. A sequel to this game was made for the Mega Drive, Pocket Monster II. The ending is an image of some Pikachus.\nThe graphics are ripped from numerous sources. The backgrounds are ripped from numerous Mega Drive games, including Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster's Hidden Treasure, Mr. Nutz, Quackshot, Magical Taruruuto-kun and Monster World IV. The graphics from the latter aren't present in the SNES version. The level graphics of the fourth and the last stage of the SNES version was ripped from Skyblazer. Some of the enemy sprites are ripped from Syd of Valis, and one of the enemy sprites appears to be taken from Super Metroid. The intro, as well as several other graphics are taken from the Pokémon anime.\n\nThe music in the Mega Drive version seems to be mostly original, although the opening theme is based on the Goten vs. Trunks theme of Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden 3 (also used in the bootleg Dragon Ball: Final Bout), and there is music from Shui Hu Feng Yun Zhuan (2nd stage, bosses and last stage, also used in Mortal Combat 5) and Hercules 2 (3rd stage). Strangely, in the Mega Drive version, Pikachu constantly says his name on the title screen, when hit and upon losing a life while he's mute in the SNES game. This is probably because the SNES version's audio is an unedited rip from the game Bonkers and it might've been too difficult to do digitized audio on the system.\n\nDifferences Between Mega Drive/Genesis And SNES Versions \nThe Mega Drive version doesn't credit any company to making it, while the SNES version claims to be made by DVS Electronic Co.\nThe music is completely different in both games, with the Mega Drive version having a mix of original music and music from Shui Hu Feng Yun Zhuan and Hercules 2, while the SNES version takes the music from Bonkers.\nThe sound effects are also different in the two games, although with both they're in PCM format. One of them in the Mega Drive version is taken from Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.\nThe \"Pikachu\" sound effect isn't present in the SNES version, but is replaced with a \"Yow!\" sound clip from Bonkers.\nThere are numerous minor graphical differences between the two versions.\nThe Mega Drive version is set to Normal difficulty by default, while the SNES version is set to Easy.\nThe mini-boss in the first level isn't in the SNES version.\nMany of the bosses in the SNES version are smaller and follow a set movement pattern.\nThe fourth and fifth levels are completely different, aside from boss of level four.\nIn the ending, the background scrolls in the Mega Drive version while there's an ending message in the SNES version.\nIn the Mega Drive version, Pikachu can jump in mid-air before he falls down after touching an enemy. This is also present in Pocket Monster II.\nIn the Mega Drive version, you fight Onix as the final boss. In the SNES version, you fight recolors of the previous bosses with A.I. differences.\nThe boxart of the Mega Drive version features a picture of Pikachu traced from the cover of a Japan-exclusive N64 title Hey You, Pikachu! as well as several logos such as \"New Game\" and \"2000\", all covering the cover art of another N64 exclusive, Pokemon Stadium 2, as well as the original Nintendo and N64 logos. One half of the game's logo also comes from Hey You, Pikachu!, making its' title half-Chinese and half-Japanese; in its' entirety, it reads as 皮卡丘 げんきでちゅう (Píkǎqiū Gen Ki De Chu).\n\nTrivia \nThe box of the SNES version from DVS Electronic uses the same image of Pikachu and the smaller \"Pocket Monsters\" logo also found on the Pocket Monster Go! Go variation of Monster Go! Go! Go!!.\nThis bootleg became somewhat popular due to a JonTron YouTube video.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"141475","WikipediaURL":"http://bootleggames.wikia.com/wiki/Pocket_Monster_(Mega_Drive/SNES)","Platform":"Sega Genesis","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Chuanpu Technology","Publisher":"X-Boy"},"Pocket Monsters 2":{"Name":"Pocket Monsters 2","Overview":"Pocket Monster II is a platform game for the Sega Mega Drive and it's the direct sequel to Pocket Monster, both probably developed by ex-workers from Chuanpu Technology and perhaps published by X Boy. Unlike the first game, no SNES port has yet been discovered.\nThis game shows a significant improvement over the original, as both the artwork and audio has been improved since the first game, though the former is still mostly stolen from other games and it still shows all the previous glitches, in addition to a new one. The music is mostly remade from the Japanese Pokémon TV series, with songs including the original Japanese opening theme (Stage 1 and Stage 4) and the ending theme of the pilot. (Boss theme.)\n\nControls\nRather simple, you move with the control pad and jump with the 'C' button. Unlike in Pocket Monster, Pikachu cannot use a screen-wide electric attack.  Instead, he can toss Pokéballs with the 'B' button (when they are collected). You can kill enemies with them, but are rather useless thanks to their lacking range and the fact that you drop all of your Pokéballs when you get hit.\nSummary\nThis game is incredibly short overall, as it only contains four levels with a sole final boss at the final one.  However, the length of the game comes in punishing slightly careless actions with a very large amount of leaps of faith and overall blind jumps, in combination with the lack of checkpoints. Also, despite the game has very few stages, they're incredibly long, so all of this makes the game aggravating at times.\nThe four levels are also incredibly generic. They have no names, but their themes are the following: forest, canyon/valley, castle, and power plant. The only one of the four levels with a specific mechanic is the third, with a button-activated door.\n\nAs mentioned before, the game punishes any mistake you make.  Falling down is almost a guarantee if you don't have the map completely memorized.  However, the plentiful extra life pickups, which regenerate upon death, keep you from getting a Game Over too soon.\n\nGlitches\nIt's no surprise that this has more than a couple of glitches...\nPikachu can only control the height of his jump while standing perfectly still, making it incredibly difficult to dodge certain enemies while progressing through the stage.\nOn that same note, Pikachu can jump down from vertically moving platforms (moving up) if he jumps too low.\nThe moving platforms can sometimes disappear if they are by the edge of the screen, due to objects being programmed to disappear if they scroll off screen.\nThere's an odd glitch that causes random hits on pokemon due to iffy hit detection.  This is common in other bootleg games.\nUsing a certain variation of this glitch, you can defeat the final boss easily.\nPikachu can jump again after jumping on a Pokémon.  (Also applies to whenever Pikachu is damaged)\nWhen a Pokéball is tossed and on-screen, it moves as Pikachu does.\nSometimes, when you throw a Pokéball to an enemy, the game freezes. It seems to happen both in emulators and in real hardware.\nTrivia \nSome music tracks from this game were reused in Fengkuang Dafuweng (aka Crazy Richman/Crazy Monopoly) by Vast Fame.\nThe level graphics from level 2 seem to be taken from Mega Man X's (SNES) Sting Chameleon stage.\nThe level graphics from level 3 are taken from Pink Goes To Hollywood\nThe level graphics from level 4 are taken from Sparkster on the SNES and some of the enemies are taken from a variety of Megadrive games including Mega Bomberman and Magical Taruruuto-kun (the latter, fittingly, was developed by Game Freak, the creators of Pokémon.) \nThe crab and the blue monkey from the first level were stolen from a original licenced Sega Genesis game Wonder Boy in Monster World by Westone.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"141495","Platform":"Sega Genesis","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{}},"Populous":{"Name":"Populous","ReleaseDate":"1989-06-05T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Now it's your chance to play God!

With the help of his fellow Strider Sheena, Hiryu uncovers a conspiracy between a certain faction of the Strider organization led by Matic himself and an unknown organization known simply as the \"Enterprise\" (headed by a man named Faceas Clay) which involves the development of a mind-control weapon codenamed \"Zain\". In the course of finding and destroying these Zain units, Hiryu learns that the faction of conspirators is headed by Vice Director Matic himself.

All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vv1YcNzcBY","DatabaseID":"4641","CommunityRating":"3.5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Baseball_2020","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Sports","Developer":"SNK","Publisher":"Electronic Arts"},"Super Battle Tank - War in the Gulf":{"Name":"Garry Kitchen's Super Battletank: War in the Gulf","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Garry Kitchen's Super Battletank: War in the Gulf, is a tank simulation game for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear.

The player has only limited funds, requiring taxation of the conquered territories while ensuring that they are not so over-taxed that they revolt against the player. The player begins the game with simple pistols, progressing through increasingly destructive weaponry that includes Uzis, miniguns, flamethrowers, sniper rifles, time bombs, lasers and the enormously destructive Gauss gun (a rocket launcher). In addition, the player can use items such as medikits to heal his agents, scanners to locate pedestrians/vehicles and the \"Persuadertron\" to brainwash the player's targets into blind obedience.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"706","CommunityRating":"3.75","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ESRB":"T - Teen","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Shooter; Strategy","Developer":"Bullfrog Productions","Publisher":"Electronic Arts"},"T2 - The Arcade Game":{"Name":"T2: The Arcade Game","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film.

The game was not released in any region; the reason why is unknown.
