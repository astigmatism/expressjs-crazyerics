Wild Joe, the southpaw flamethrower, stares in to his catcher for what seems like minutes. He nods slowly and steps into his windup. He throws a heater right under the Champ's chin. The big man falls to the ground to avoid getting hit. He sits there a second, glaring at Wild Joe, then slowly rises to his feet. The tension is as thick as peanut butter as he steps back into the box. Wild Joe's next two pitches, breaking balls, shave the corners of the plate, bringing the count to I and 2. The Champ steps out of the box and peers at the coach down at the hot corner, who touches his cap, his number, his elbow, then the tip of his nose. But the signal does not fool anyone. Everybody knows the Champ will swing for the cheap seats. Wild Joe winds up and burns a fireball across the heart of the plate. The Champ steps into it, head down, and brings his 38-ounce bat around as though it were a child's toy. Crack! The bat launches a rocket to the deepest part of the yard. Centerfielder Yazoo Sherman races toward the fence and leaps at the warning track, but he never stood a chance.

A graphical representation of the track, lap times, speed meter and rear view mirrors are always in display. One button accelerates, another brakes. Left and right on the joypad steers while up and down shifts gears if manual transmission (either 4 or 7 gears) has been selected beforehand. Crashing into other cars sends the own car into a spin while hitting roadside obstacles (trees, bushes, rocks or animals) reduces speed to zero.\n\nThe game can be played by up to six players via a ComLynx connection.

At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix — a sticklike entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle.\n\nThe player controls a Stix that can move around the edges of the rectangle. Holding down one of the draw buttons allows the marker to move into unclaimed territory in an attempt to create a closed shape. If completed, the captured area (defined as the side opposite of where the Qix is) becomes filled in with a solid color and points are awarded. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% of the playfield (adjustable by the arcade operator to be between 50% and 90%).\n\nThe player's marker can move at two different speeds; areas drawn exclusively at the slower speed (orange-red on the screenshot shown) are worth double points. It cannot cross or backtrack along a line in progress.\n\nA life is lost if the Qix touches a line as it is being drawn or if the marker is touched by any of the Sparx – enemies that traverse all playfield edges except uncompleted lines. In addition, if the marker stops while drawing a line, a fuse will appear and burn along the uncompleted line toward the marker; if it reaches the marker, the player loses one life. The fuse disappears once the player moves the marker again. The player has no defenses against the enemies and must out-maneuver them in order to survive.\n\nA meter at the top of the screen counts down to the release of additional Sparx, and the mutation of all Sparx into Super Sparx which can chase the player up an uncompleted line.\n\nAfter the player completes two levels, the difficulty increases by the inclusion of multiple Qixes, additional Sparx, speed increases, and the eventual appearance of only Super Sparx. In levels with multiple Qixes, the player can also complete the level by splitting the playfield into two regions, each containing at least one Qix.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=641-xq1lYaQ","DatabaseID":"27052","CommunityRating":"2.5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix","Platform":"Atari Lynx","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Knight Technologies","Publisher":"Telegames"},"Raiden":{"Name":"Raiden","ReleaseYear":"1997","Overview":"In the year 2090, Earth has suddenly become the target of deranged aliens known as the Cranassians.
