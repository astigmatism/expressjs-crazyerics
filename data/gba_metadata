Red stars are bigger than the white. The white star is able to orbit red stars to help travel through space. Whenever the white star grows large enough, the target star glows orange, and is able to be a satellite; as soon as that happens, a small crescent star appears, and having it successfully orbit the white star will give the player bonus points, (and collecting all different crescent stars unlocks new galaxies and are the goal to complete the game 100%). Colliding with the orange star will take away a hit, but having it orbit the white star will clear the round. The player guides the star by pressing the A and B buttons on the Wii Remote to utilize gravity and anti-gravity, respectively, and attract it towards or repel against (also respectively) the gravitational wells of celestial objects.

The game was simultaneously announced with Dragon Quest VIII in Famitsu in 2002. Like the other Dragon Quest titles, development of Caravan Heart was led by Yuji Horii.\n\nIt is the second Dragon Quest game to be released for the Game Boy Advance (after Torneko no Daibouken 2 Advance). Caravan Heart features the character Prince Keifer from Dragon Quest VII, as the game acts as a prequel to the PlayStation game. This is also the last Dragon Quest released under the Enix name, since the merger between Square and Enix was finalized a few days later, on April 1, 2003.\n\nThe game makes huge changes to the series by removing the breeding system. Instead, when defeating monsters in Caravan Heart, the player can occasionally gain \"monster hearts\" which can be used to merge into a monster for a new more powerful form. Humans also fight in the battles with the monsters in this installment. The human characters have access to 20 character classes, like hunter, bard, fighter, dancer, mage, and mapper. Other differences include a caravan that the player must travel around in, allowing them to add both monsters and humans to their party. The caravan can have up to twelve members in it at a time, and each wagon can only hold a certain amount of weight.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"19066","CommunityRating":"2","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_Monsters:_Caravan_Heart","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","CommunityRatingCount":"8","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Enix"},"Dragon Tales - Dragon Adventures":{"Name":"Dragon Tales: Dragon Adventures","ReleaseDate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Wish on Dragon Scale and get whisked away to Dragon Land.

Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \"Doctor Doom\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3462","CommunityRating":"0.5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Action","Developer":"7 Studios","Publisher":"Activision"},"Fantastic 4 - Flame On":{"Name":"Fantastic 4: Flame On","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"You are the Human Torch!

The quirky title, which was developed by Runecraft Software, lets players choose a character from a selection of five dancing DJs and selecting a skill level, players jump immediately into the guts of the game. The point is to maneuver the selected DJ from left to right and shoot bubbles at their colored counterparts as they slowly advance across a nine-by-nine grid. It's fairly simple stuff, but it is made slightly more complicated as three matching bubbles, be them in horizontal or vertical form, cancel each other out, award players points, and help clear the battlefield.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"22344","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Runecraft","Publisher":"Jaleco Entertainment"},"Super Bust-A-Move":{"Name":"Super Bust-A-Move","ReleaseDate":"2001-11-27T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Super Puzzle Bobble introduces some new elements to the series (and removes some others):\n\n    Large bubbles are found in certain levels. Shooting a bubble of the same color at them makes every bubble in the level change into that color.\n    In some levels, the pointer and the bubbles that are shot are of a very small size, enabling the player to shoot bubbles between small gaps. These bubbles grow into normal size after being clustered.\n    Occasionally, a conveyor belt will surround the level. This makes bouncing off the ceiling and the walls significantly tricky, since the bubbles' trajectory will change upon bouncing.\n    Levels do not always have the usual rectangular shape. Some of them are jagged or have walls inside them, which forces the player to change strategy.\n    Small blocks appear in some levels. They change the bubbles' trajectories, much like walls, but they move down with the level and fall off when they touch the line.\n    The pulley system introduced in Puzzle Bobble 4 is nowhere to be seen.\n    Chain Reaction is only present in 2P battles, but it is completely optional.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3514","CommunityRating":"2.7","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"5","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Taito","Publisher":"Ubisoft"},"Super Dodgeball Advance":{"Name":"Super Dodge Ball Advance","ReleaseDate":"2001-03-21T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Super Dodge Ball Advance, based on the NES classic, takes place in the not-so-distant future when the sport of preteens has become the sport of kings and national pride hangs on the home team's ability to triumph in the number-one worldwide sport.
