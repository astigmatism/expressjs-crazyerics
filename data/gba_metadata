Whenever the white star grows large enough, the target star glows orange, and is able to be a satellite; as soon as that happens, a small crescent star appears, and having it successfully orbit the white star will give the player bonus points, (and collecting all different crescent stars unlocks new galaxies and are the goal to complete the game 100%). Colliding with the orange star will take away a hit, but having it orbit the white star will clear the round. The player guides the star by pressing the A and B buttons on the Wii Remote to utilize gravity and anti-gravity, respectively, and attract it towards or repel against (also respectively) the gravitational wells of celestial objects. Players must be careful not to crash their star into the red stars or floating objects like asteroids, or be sucked into black holes, which takes away a hit (and in the case of black holes, restart the entire stage).","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"124360","CommunityRating":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"Skip Ltd.","Publisher":"Nintendo"},"Bit Generations Soundvoyager":{"Name":"Bit Generations: Soundvoyager","ReleaseDate":"2006-07-27T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Soundvoyager is intended to be played using sound only, without looking at the console's screen.

They have used this chemical to strengthen hostility and athletic genes to produce an original species of insurgent. The Counter Terrorist Special Intervention Forces are the only ones who possess the strength and skill to crush this new adversary. Each player is responsible for controlling his or her member of the CT Special Forces, as each mission becomes increasingly difficult. In the latest threat of terrorism, the need for underwater soldiers has become a necessity. With scuba diving skills, the player can explore several underwater regions. Combat takes place in both the water and on land, so the game presents the player with a number of vehicle and weaponry options. Each skill is the most sophisticated available and designed to seek out and destroy the enemy. The game takes the player through 20 levels that test, challenge and drive the Special Forces towards victory. Fans of combat action games with a patriotic tone must try this intense game.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"19438","CommunityRating":"3.1666666666666665","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"T - Teen","CommunityRatingCount":"9","Genres":"Action","Developer":"LSP","Publisher":"LSP"},"Cabbage Patch Kids - The Patch Puppy Rescue":{"Name":"Cabbage Patch Kids: The Patch Puppy Rescue","ReleaseDate":"2006-04-11T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The Cabbage Patch Kids recently rescued puppies and are holding a lunch in town square to celebrate their new additions.

The game was simultaneously announced with Dragon Quest VIII in Famitsu in 2002. Like the other Dragon Quest titles, development of Caravan Heart was led by Yuji Horii.\n\nIt is the second Dragon Quest game to be released for the Game Boy Advance (after Torneko no Daibouken 2 Advance). Caravan Heart features the character Prince Keifer from Dragon Quest VII, as the game acts as a prequel to the PlayStation game. This is also the last Dragon Quest released under the Enix name, since the merger between Square and Enix was finalized a few days later, on April 1, 2003.\n\nThe game makes huge changes to the series by removing the breeding system. Instead, when defeating monsters in Caravan Heart, the player can occasionally gain \"monster hearts\" which can be used to merge into a monster for a new more powerful form. Humans also fight in the battles with the monsters in this installment. The human characters have access to 20 character classes, like hunter, bard, fighter, dancer, mage, and mapper. Other differences include a caravan that the player must travel around in, allowing them to add both monsters and humans to their party. The caravan can have up to twelve members in it at a time, and each wagon can only hold a certain amount of weight.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"19066","CommunityRating":"2","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_Monsters:_Caravan_Heart","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","CommunityRatingCount":"8","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Enix"},"Dragon Tales - Dragon Adventures":{"Name":"Dragon Tales: Dragon Adventures","ReleaseDate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Wish on Dragon Scale and get whisked away to Dragon Land.

Jim (voiced by TenNapel) was at first an ordinary earthworm who did very earthworm-like things such as flee from crows and eat dirt. One day, in the space above Earth, the evil Psy-Crow had cornered a rebel spaceship pilot who had stolen an \"Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit\" built by Professor Monkey-for-a-Head. The suit had been commissioned by the evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt so that she could further conquer the galaxy. In the ensuing space fight, the suit was dropped to Earth, and fell on Jim.

Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \"Doctor Doom\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3462","CommunityRating":"0.5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Action","Developer":"7 Studios","Publisher":"Activision"},"Fantastic 4 - Flame On":{"Name":"Fantastic 4: Flame On","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"You are the Human Torch!

Renamed Penny Racers for the benefit of American sales, the wind-up cars were built to perform different tricks (wheelies and spins, mostly) when a penny was inserted into their chassis. The plastic racers are still very popular in Japan, inspiring a video game called CHORO-Q ADVANCE. The U.S. release of the game is called GADGET RACERS, and it's every bit as exciting as the toys that it's based on. Command any of 50 unique vehicles through 40 different courses of obstacles, tricks, and general mayhem. You can customize your racer to meet your specifications, using more than 130 different parts to soup things up upgrade your tires, brakes, steering, engines, and more. Adding to the excitement is the fact that you can get four players competing for glory via a link cable and for Game Boy Advance consoles. It's a mystery why the toys no longer roam the bedroom floors of American households, but maybe this awesome video game will create a resurgence.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"25934","CommunityRating":"4.5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"Takara","Publisher":"Conspiracy Entertainment"},"Galidor - Defenders of the Outer Dimension":{"Name":"Galidor: Defenders of the Outer Dimension","ReleaseDate":"2002-10-29T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Taking on the role of the hero Nick Bluetooth -- straight out of the hit Fox Kids TV series, GALIDORTM: Defenders of the Outer Dimension -- players find themselves in an Outer Dimension on an action-packed quest to free friends who have fallen into the clutches of the evil tyrant Gorm.\n\nWith the ultimate goal of finding the portal to GALIDORTM and ridding the Outer Dimension of its wicked ruler, Nick encounters many challenges and menacing creatures along the way.

These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted.\n\nAs in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina.\n\nFinally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3467","CommunityRating":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Developer":"Eurocom Entertainment Software","Publisher":"EA"},"Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire":{"Name":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Harry, Ron, and Hermione are back in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--a game based on J.K.

Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.\n\nIn Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no \"generic\" units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.\n\nEach allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.\n\nBattle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3682","CommunityRating":"4.25","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Force#Remake","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"T - Teen","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Amusement Vision","Publisher":"Sega"},"Shining Soul":{"Name":"Shining Soul","ReleaseDate":"2003-09-16T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Enter a world of magic and mystery, where your closest allies may sometimes turn out to be your worst enemies.

The Professor is about to give him a warp device that will allow him to travel to all the other lands, when Ripto appears through the hole and claims the device for himself with the advantage he can rapidly conquer the surrounding lands. Ripto warps out Spyro along with Sparx and Butler to the Dragon Shores.\nAfter Spyro is able to travel back to the Professor's Lab and travel through the peephole's vortex to Rypto's Chateau, he finds Ripto about to lower the Professor into a pit of lava, but engages in combat with Spyro.

The GBA game puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15 year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes. Fans of the comics will enjoy how ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN draws on the comic style and storyline, while movie fans will like getting to see another chapter in the Spider-Man legacy.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"20823","CommunityRating":"5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Action","Developer":"Vicarious Visions","Publisher":"Activision"},"Ultimate Winter Games":{"Name":"Ultimate Winter Games","ReleaseDate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Ultimate Winter Games features four different Olympic-style events to play: Downhill Skiing, Snowboarding, Bobsled, and Curling.

There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka.

The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations.\n\nThe worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to fancy combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is then thrown against a mine which sets off another worm, which hits a third worm who slips into the water.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"2353","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"6","Genres":"Shooter; Strategy","Developer":"Team17","Publisher":"Team17"},"X-Bladez - Inline Skater":{"Name":"X-Bladez Inline Skater","ReleaseDate":"2003-03-30T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Get ready to race in the greatest cities of the world in countries like Britain, America, France, China, Australia and South America.
