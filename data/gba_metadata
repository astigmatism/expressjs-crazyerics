Colliding with these stars will not change the white star's size, but if the player positions the white star just right, the gray star will orbit the white and become a satellite. Red stars are bigger than the white. The white star is able to orbit red stars to help travel through space. Whenever the white star grows large enough, the target star glows orange, and is able to be a satellite; as soon as that happens, a small crescent star appears, and having it successfully orbit the white star will give the player bonus points, (and collecting all different crescent stars unlocks new galaxies and are the goal to complete the game 100%).

Doragon Kuesuto Monsutazu Kyaraban Hato?) (Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart) is the third game in the Dragon Quest Monsters series, released only in Japan by Enix for the Game Boy Advance. The game was simultaneously announced with Dragon Quest VIII in Famitsu in 2002. Like the other Dragon Quest titles, development of Caravan Heart was led by Yuji Horii.\n\nIt is the second Dragon Quest game to be released for the Game Boy Advance (after Torneko no Daibouken 2 Advance). Caravan Heart features the character Prince Keifer from Dragon Quest VII, as the game acts as a prequel to the PlayStation game. This is also the last Dragon Quest released under the Enix name, since the merger between Square and Enix was finalized a few days later, on April 1, 2003.\n\nThe game makes huge changes to the series by removing the breeding system. Instead, when defeating monsters in Caravan Heart, the player can occasionally gain \"monster hearts\" which can be used to merge into a monster for a new more powerful form. Humans also fight in the battles with the monsters in this installment. The human characters have access to 20 character classes, like hunter, bard, fighter, dancer, mage, and mapper. Other differences include a caravan that the player must travel around in, allowing them to add both monsters and humans to their party. The caravan can have up to twelve members in it at a time, and each wagon can only hold a certain amount of weight.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"19066","CommunityRating":"2","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_Monsters:_Caravan_Heart","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","CommunityRatingCount":"8","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"TOSE","Publisher":"Enix"},"Dragon Tales - Dragon Adventures":{"Name":"Dragon Tales: Dragon Adventures","ReleaseDate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Wish on Dragon Scale and get whisked away to Dragon Land.

Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \"Doctor Doom\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3462","CommunityRating":"0.5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Action","Developer":"7 Studios","Publisher":"Activision"},"Fantastic 4 - Flame On":{"Name":"Fantastic 4: Flame On","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"You are the Human Torch!

Renamed Penny Racers for the benefit of American sales, the wind-up cars were built to perform different tricks (wheelies and spins, mostly) when a penny was inserted into their chassis. The plastic racers are still very popular in Japan, inspiring a video game called CHORO-Q ADVANCE. The U.S. release of the game is called GADGET RACERS, and it's every bit as exciting as the toys that it's based on. Command any of 50 unique vehicles through 40 different courses of obstacles, tricks, and general mayhem. You can customize your racer to meet your specifications, using more than 130 different parts to soup things up upgrade your tires, brakes, steering, engines, and more. Adding to the excitement is the fact that you can get four players competing for glory via a link cable and for Game Boy Advance consoles. It's a mystery why the toys no longer roam the bedroom floors of American households, but maybe this awesome video game will create a resurgence.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"25934","CommunityRating":"4.5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Racing","Developer":"Takara","Publisher":"Conspiracy Entertainment"},"Galidor - Defenders of the Outer Dimension":{"Name":"Galidor: Defenders of the Outer Dimension","ReleaseDate":"2002-10-29T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Taking on the role of the hero Nick Bluetooth -- straight out of the hit Fox Kids TV series, GALIDORTM: Defenders of the Outer Dimension -- players find themselves in an Outer Dimension on an action-packed quest to free friends who have fallen into the clutches of the evil tyrant Gorm.\n\nWith the ultimate goal of finding the portal to GALIDORTM and ridding the Outer Dimension of its wicked ruler, Nick encounters many challenges and menacing creatures along the way.

The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive (and advance the plot) Harry must again complete various challenges. These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted.\n\nAs in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina.\n\nFinally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3467","CommunityRating":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Developer":"Eurocom Entertainment Software","Publisher":"EA"},"Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire":{"Name":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","ReleaseDate":"2005-11-08T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Harry, Ron, and Hermione are back in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--a game based on J.K.

There are three variations: in \"Puzzle,\" the challenge is to remove all shapes from play with the set amount of pieces. In \"Wipeout\", you've got two minutes to remove all shapes from play with an infinite amount of pieces.

Pinobee can walk along the ground or shimmy up walls, but his main means of locomotion is dashing through the air. As he makes it deeper in his quest, Pinobee gains the ability to dash farther and farther through the air. Soon enough, he's spending more time hovering and dashing through the sky than on the ground.

It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if who desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy.

Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.\n\nIn Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no \"generic\" units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.\n\nEach allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.\n\nBattle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"3682","CommunityRating":"4.25","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Force#Remake","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"T - Teen","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Amusement Vision","Publisher":"Sega"},"Shining Soul":{"Name":"Shining Soul","ReleaseDate":"2003-09-16T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Enter a world of magic and mystery, where your closest allies may sometimes turn out to be your worst enemies.

The Professor is about to give him a warp device that will allow him to travel to all the other lands, when Ripto appears through the hole and claims the device for himself with the advantage he can rapidly conquer the surrounding lands.

There is a hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating in water. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka.

It is possible to fire the bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an \"arch\", allowing players to reach difficult areas.\n\nShooting blocks will have one of two effects:\n\nIf you hit a block that is either the same colour as your bazooka missile, or is a rainbow block, that block and any other same-coloured or rainbow blocks connected to it will be destroyed.

The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations.\n\nThe worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to fancy combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is then thrown against a mine which sets off another worm, which hits a third worm who slips into the water.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"2353","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Advance","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"6","Genres":"Shooter; Strategy","Developer":"Team17","Publisher":"Team17"},"X-Bladez - Inline Skater":{"Name":"X-Bladez Inline Skater","ReleaseDate":"2003-03-30T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Get ready to race in the greatest cities of the world in countries like Britain, America, France, China, Australia and South America.
