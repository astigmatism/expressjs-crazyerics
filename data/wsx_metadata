It uses the characters from Tekken 3, including an exclusive playable character to the game, Crow, which was previously appeared as NPCs in the original.\n\nTekken Card Challenge utilizes a system similar to its Pokémon counterpart. Two opponents are to fight at a time, with various cards for different maneuvers and a 100 point HP total for damage accumulation. The player begins with a hand of four cards, drawing more as the duel proceeds. The battle system is similar to Yu-Gi-Oh! in that the three types of cards perform in a rock, paper, and scissors pattern. Attack cards are played against each other to compare values with the loser being discarded and deducting HP, an attack card played against a defense nullifies each other (except in the case of a counter), and two block cards cancel each other out. There is also a minor system of air juggling, which can be quite damaging given the correct order of cards.\n\nTekken Card Challenge also provides the player with a variety of game modes. There is a link mode present, 1-player battle, and (the main mode) Adventure, which allows the player to unlock more characters and duel opponents. In adventure mode, the player is given movement of a character sprite in a full environment taken place on a 15 x 15 square grid to traverse. The point of each stage is to defeat each \"duelist\" given limited number of steps and gain entrance to the exit.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27674","Platform":"WonderSwan","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Fighting","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco"},"Terrors":{"Name":"Terrors","ReleaseDate":"1999-08-05T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Terrors is an Adventure game, developed by Megas and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 1999.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27675","Platform":"WonderSwan","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"Megas","Publisher":"Bandai"},"Terrors 2":{"Name":"Terrors 2","ReleaseDate":"2000-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Terrors 2 is an Adventure game, developed by Megas and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2000.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27764","Platform":"WonderSwan Color","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Adventure","Developer":"Megas","Publisher":"Bandai"},"Tetris":{"Name":"Tetris","ReleaseDate":"2002-04-18T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Your pulse quickens.
