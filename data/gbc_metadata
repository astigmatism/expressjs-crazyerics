The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the \"Instant Fun\" option. They vary from a \"Memory\" style shield-matching game to humorous events such as \"Throw a Roman Mini Game\".\n\nBoth Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn_ratQ4Msw","DatabaseID":"24358","CommunityRating":"2.5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Developer":"Rebellion Developments Ltd.","Publisher":"Infogrames Europe SA"},"Asteroids":{"Name":"Asteroids","ReleaseDate":"1999-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Your spaceship is trapped in a deadly asteroid belt.

To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik’s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"8600","CommunityRating":"3.5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Tiertex Design Studios","Publisher":"THQ"},"Bugs Bunny & Lola Bunny - Carrot Crazy":{"Name":"Looney Tunes: Carrot Crazy","ReleaseDate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Coming home after a long day at work, Bugs and Lola find their garden ransacked and all of their carrots stolen.

As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue.

The working title during the game's development was Game Boy Wars Pocket Tactics during development.[1]\n\nThe gameplay of Game Boy Wars 3 is a departure from the previous Game Boy Wars titles, being modeled after the Nectaris series of war simulators that were also produced by Hudson. For example, indirect attack units can now move and attack at the same time in one turn. In contrast to the previous Game Boy Wars titles, having the required fund is not enough to produce certain units. The player must provide construction materials to the factories and cities as well. To do that, the player must deploy construction units to these sites and built the materials. These construction units can be used to cut down trees and create roads.\n\nGame Boy Wars 3 features a Beginner Mode, which gives the player a 16-part tutorial on how to play the game, as well as a Standard Mode in which the player can fight against the CPU or another player in one of 60 maps. There's also a Campaign Mode in which the player must fight through over 45 different maps that are dictated by a storyline, which has several branching points determined by the player's performance. A feature exclusive in the Campaign Mode is the ability to redeploy surviving units from a previous battle into the next one. Units gain experience points through combat, allowing them to be promoted from one of five ranks (D, C, B, A, and S), increasing their strength. Units who reach an S rank can be transformed into a new type of unit.\n\nOn release, Famitsu magazine scored Game Boy Wars 3 a 31 out of 40.[1]","MaxPlayers":"4","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"19081","CommunityRating":"5","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Strategy","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft"},"Ganbare Goemon - Hoshizorashi Dynamites Arawaru!!":{"Name":"Ganbare Goemon: Hoshizorashi Dynamites Arawaru!!","ReleaseDate":"2000-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Ganbare Goemon: Hoshizorashi Dynamites Arawaru!! is an Action game, published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2000.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"105249","CommunityRating":"2","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganbare_Goemon:_Hoshizorashi_Dynamites_Arawaru!!","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami"},"Ganbare Goemon - Mononoke Douchuu Tobisuise Nabebugyou!":{"Name":"Ganbare Goemon: Mononoke Sugoroku","ReleaseDate":"1999-12-16T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Ganbare Goemon: Mononoke Sugoroku is a Miscellaneous game, developed by KCEK and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1999.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"118542","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goemon_Mononoke_Sugoroku","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ESRB":"Not Rated","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Puzzle","Developer":"KCEK","Publisher":"Konami"},"Ganbare Goemon - Tengutou no Gyakushuu":{"Name":"Ganbare Goemon: Tengu-to no Gyakushu!","ReleaseDate":"1999-01-14T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Ganbare Goemon: Tengu-to no Gyakushu! is a Ganbare Goemon game released for the Game Boy Color on January 14, 1999.

As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.\n\nOutside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"8802","CommunityRating":"3.875","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","CommunityRatingCount":"4","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Developer":"Capcom","Publisher":"Capcom"},"Mia Hamm Soccer Shootout":{"Name":"Mia Hamm Soccer Shootout","ReleaseDate":"2000-10-27T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"The thrills and excitement of international women's soccer comes to the Game Boy Color with MIA HAMM SOCCER SHOOTOUT.

It includes new enhancements, such as the ability to choose the gender of the player character, a training mode to help new players, a Deck Diagnosis to rate the effectiveness of a player's deck, and a new group of antagonists known as Team Great Rocket. The game features all cards from the original game, along with new cards from the fourth set, Team Rocket, as well as cards originally exclusive to Japanese vending machines and the Pokémon Trading Card Game Instructional Video Intro Pack, bringing the total number of cards to 445.\n\nLike the previous title, players must travel across the game world challenging non-player characters to simulated battles using rules adopted from the original tabletop version. All locations from the original are present, along with a new setting known as GR Island which contains its own Battle Masters for players to encounter. By defeating a total of 16 Battle Masters on the old and new islands, players may challenge the game's final boss, King Biruritchi.

This is the only way to add the evolved form to your Pokédex. Once you select a Pokémon, you must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 6 targets, but only 3 of them have items in them you need to evolve a Pokémon. The others create a time-wasting sequence before you can hit targets again. If you hit a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once you've collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up.

Gems \"fall in\" from the top of the play area one line at a time and are connected to each other either horizontally or vertically. Hitting a gem with the ball will destroy it, and if the destroyed gem causes other gems to no longer be connected to the top of the play area, they fall off, scoring bonus points. Destroying a special flashing gem also destroys all regular gems of the same color in the playfield. There are also metallic blocks that take more than one hit to destroy.\n\nThe player controls a paddle at the bottom of the playfield, which can move left and right to bounce the ball back upward. Unlike in most other Breakout-style games, missing the ball does not cost a life or end the game, but rather adds more lines of gems to the top of the playfield. Gem lines will advance on their own after a certain amount of time, as well as when the playfield is cleared entirely or drops below a certain number of gems. If the gems advance across the line at the bottom of the playfield where the paddle resides, the player loses and the game is over.\n\nThe arcade version of Puchi Carat features three main gameplay modes: A single-player mode where the goal is to clear a certain number of gem lines, a story mode in which the player challenges each character in a head-to-head battle (where dropped gems are added to the opponent's playfield from the bottom), and a two-player versus mode following the same rules as the story mode.
