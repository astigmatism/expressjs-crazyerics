Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.\n\nThere are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle.

The tanks themselves moved by themselves with the player turning the tank and controlling the speed. This game had three lives that could be used — three hits and the player loses a life — while the original allowed you to get as many shots in until the time ran out. The graphics overall were improved over the original.\n\nThe game was cancelled, probably due to the video game crash of 1983, and was forgotten until 200 copies of the prototype were produced in cartridge form and sold at the Classic Gaming Expo in 2001. The prototype featured the unfinished game, which included the features listed above, but people were surprised to find a level editor inside the game.\n\nThe game was featured in Retro Gamer Issue 15 in the \"Games That Weren't\" section.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"24906","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Fighting; Strategy","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari"},"Commando":{"Name":"Commando","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Super Joe is armed with a sub-machine gun (which has unlimited ammunition) as well as a limited supply of hand grenades.

It was once thought that Spinning Fireball, along with Pizza Chef, Immies and Aggies, and A Mysterious Thief, were all original games developed by a PAL company called Suntek.  However after much research it has been determined that these are in fact original NTSC games released by two different companies called Zimag and Vidco, which may have been related somehow.  So why were these games developed for the NTSC market but never released?  Read on to find out.\n\nSpinning Fireball is a half hearted attempt at a 3D target shooting game.  This is probably something that shouldn't have ever been attempted on the 2600, but Vidco decided to try it anyway.  The result is a game that looks decent, but plays horribly.  The goal of the game is to have your wizard create and shoot a fireball at the catapult that movies across the top of the screen.\n\nThe controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long.  To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward.  Once the fireball starts to spin (hence the name Spinning Fireball), press the fire button to shoot it.  The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field).  If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult (and good luck with that), then you will be taken to the second level. \n\nWhile Spinning Fireball may be short on thrills, there are some dangers you will face during your fire slinging exploits.  If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you.  Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down (run!).  If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life.  Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life.  You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will (say it with me now) lose a life.  The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four).\n\nWhile it won't win any awards for good graphics or gameplay, Spinning Fireball is an interesting attempt to breathe some innovation into the tired old shooter formula.  Unfortunately the result was a game that needs more variety and polish before it could be considered fun to play.  The frustrating control scheme makes hitting the catapult more a matter of luck than skill. There's a reason these games never made it to the US.","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/tqnsOeQwTQI?t=5","DatabaseID":"128460","Platform":"Atari 2600","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{},"Publisher":"Suntek"},"Fireball":{"Name":"Fireball","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Juggle the red hot Fireball... before it becomes too hot to handle!

In this game, the player or players control a frog sitting on a lily pad. One frog is green and the other frog is red. The game can be played either by one or two players. The object of the game is to eat the most flies.\nEach game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen – the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a \"The End\" message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner.\nThere are two different levels to Frogs and Flies that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water – in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad.\nA version of this game was also released for Mattel's IntelliVision system, titled Frog Bog; though it was graphically superior to Frogs and Flies, its controls were less fluent.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"18549","CommunityRating":"4.1","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"5","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Mattel","Publisher":"Mattel"},"Front Line":{"Name":"Front Line","Overview":"Front Line (フロントライン Furonto Rain?) is a military-themed run & gun shooter game released by Taito for arcades in 1982.

In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players.

Yes you heard me right, Mind Maze is the first (and only) Atari game to be based on the unproven (yet still popular) theory of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).  It appears Atari was attempting to develop a sort of \"Mind Reading\" game for its new Mindlink controller.  So can the 2600 really read your thoughts?  Read on to find out...\n\nMind Maze is played somewhat like those old mind reading experiments where a scientist would hold up a card and ask a person to tell him what was on the other side.  Depending on the game selected, two to four cards appear on the screen each round.  The player then must try and guess the \"correct\" card by highlighting it (using the joystick) and pressing the fire button.  Unfortunately this is where the game begins to fall apart.  As you've probably guessed the theory of ESP is pretty far fetched, and the odds that the player can continually guess the correct card is slim.  So the player must simply sit there and randomly select cards until he by chance selects the correct one.  Predictably, this gets boring very fast...\n\nAfter choosing a card all but one of the card pictures will disappear, and the computer will then highlight the \"correct\" card on the screen.  If the player is playing with the \"Race\" option, the game will show a solid blue screen and wait for the player to press a button before continuing to the next round.  This blue screen (which would have been spruced up for the final release) was probably there to allow the other player to get ready for his turn.  However since there is no two player option in this version, it doesn't really serve any point.  The player may also \"pass\" on the current set of cards by pressing the button without selecting a card.  This will cause a new set of cards to appear but it will still be the players turn.  There doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of times you can pass, but the game will not advance until the player picks a card.\n\nThe current score is shown at the bottom of the screen.  The left digit appears to be the players score, while the right digit counts the number of rounds played.  When the player reaches 20 points they win the game and are returned to the main screen.  By setting the right difficulty switch to B, the player can activate the \"Cheat\" mode.  When the cheat mode is activated selecting any card will score the player points (thus making the game completely pointless).  When the switch is put back in A position the scoring is set back to normal (as normal as scoring gets in this game anyway).  The cheat mode was probably put in by the programmer to help the ESP challenged debug the game.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Mind Maze appears to have several options which can be set for each game.  The main screen lists four options: # of Choices (2, 3, or 4), Race/No Race, Picture/Color, and Past/Future.  \n\n# of Choices\t- This sets the number of cards that appears on the screen.  The game defaults to two choices, but can be set as high as four.  Obviously the more choices there are, the harder the game becomes.\n\nRace/No Race - This option is for setting up a two player \"race\" game.  The only visible effect this option seems to have is activating or deactivating the blue screen.  Setting the game to 'Race' causes the solid blue screen to appear between rounds, while setting it to 'No Race' skips this screen.\n\nPicture/Color - This option affects the cards themselves.  Selecting 'Picture' will cause the game to display a series of beautiful pictures on the cards (everything from castles to goldfish), while selecting color will replace these pictures with a block of solid color.  When playing the 'Color' game, the picture actually hides behind one of the cards and is not visible to the player.  Selecting one of the cards will cause the picture to be revealed and the game will proceed to the next round (after awarding the appropriate points). \n\nPast/Future - Out of all the options in the game, this one is the strangest.  As the name suggests this option affects the order in which players try to predict the cards (trying to guess the card that was just played or the card about to be played).  If set to Past the 2600 will select the \"correct\" card before the player chooses.  If the option is set to Future the 2600 will select the correct card as the player chooses.\n\nUnlike more advanced games such as Motorodeo, the player cannot actually change the game options directly.  Instead the player must keep selecting game numbers until the combination of rules he wants is found.  Since there are four different options (one with three choices), there are a whopping 24 different game variations in this prototype (3*2*2*2).  Not too shabby for a game from 1984.\n\nIf you haven't already noticed by the screenshots, the graphics in Mind Maze are absolutely gorgeous.  Each picture is large and well detailed (a rarity on the 2600).  The graphics also have a really cool 'Fade In' effect that adds a bit of eye candy to an otherwise drab looking game.  Excellent graphics in a game so early in the development cycle are rare, as the programmer usually put bland 'placeholder' graphics in until the gameplay was finished.  One has to wonder what other little surprises the programmer had in store for us.\n\nAlthough Mind Maze is constantly listed as being a Mindlink game, this prototype doesn't appear to use or require the strange controller.  However according to the programmers,  Mind Maze was definitely meant to be a Mindlink game.  Supposedly the headband was to read the players Alpha and Beta waves in an attempt to help predict their actions.  However since the Mindlink was really just a sensor that detected muscle movements in the players forehead, this was complete bunk.  The whole mind reading idea was just another angle thought up by Atari's marketing department.\n\nAlthough the theory behind Mind Maze was pretty far out there, it does show just how far Atari was willing to go to develop games for its new Mindlink controller.  Mind Maze was ultimately scrapped due to to the limited appeal of the \"game\" (or perhaps the marketing department finally stopped smoking those funny little cigarettes).  However Mind Maze would not be the last game to dabble in the paranormal, several years later another mind reading game called \"Taboo: The Sixth Sense\" was released for the NES.  Unfortunately this game was pretty much laughed off the store shelves and faded into obscurity.  It appears that Atari made the right decision after all.","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/4RjtuUGcTu4?t=5","DatabaseID":"128561","Platform":"Atari 2600","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{},"Developer":"Gary Shannon","Publisher":"Atari"},"Miner 2049er":{"Name":"Miner 2049er","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Using the joystick control maneuver Bounty Bob through the mine gathering the blocks of ore, old miner possessions and killing the mutants which scores points.

The game is composed of 3D color vector graphics. This game was developed during the Golden Age of Arcade Games and is considered the #4 most popular game of all time according to the readers of Killer List of Videogames.[3]\n\n\nThe player assumes the role of Luke Skywalker (\"Red Five\"), as he pilots an X-wing fighter from a first-person perspective. Unlike other arcade games of similar nature, the player does not have to destroy every enemy in order to advance through the game; he must simply survive as his fighter flies through the level, which most often means he must avoid or destroy the shots that enemies fire. Each hit on his craft takes away one shield (of the six he started out with), and if he runs out of shields and takes another hit, the game ends.\n\nThe player's ultimate goal is to destroy the Death Star through three attack phases.\n\nIn the first phase of the game, the player begins in outer space above the Death Star. He must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and enemy TIE fighters.\nIn the second phase, the player reaches the Death Star's surface as laser turrets on towers rise to confront the player. The player is awarded a bonus if they manage to destroy a certain number of turrets.\nIn the final scenario, the player must navigate the trench of the Death Star, avoiding obstacles and gun turrets until finally firing a proton torpedo at the correct time for a direct hit on the exhaust port target. If the player is successful, the Death Star explodes and the player is awarded a bonus shield up to a maximum of 6. Should the player fail to hit the exhaust port, a shield is lost and the player must attempt the trench again. If the player manages to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, they are awarded a bonus for \"using the Force.\"\nThe game then resets to the first phase. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases the difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in the second round, and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run. Unlike the movie, where the units shoot beams similar to lasers, the enemy units in this game shoot projectiles resembling fireballs, in order to give the player a chance to destroy the fired shots.[2]","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"28592","CommunityRating":"2.4285714285714284","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"7","Genres":"Shooter","Developer":"Imagic","Publisher":"Parker Brothers"},"Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back":{"Name":"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back recreates a scene from the movie of the same name.

More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game.[2]\n\nThe game is divided into ten sections, plus a finale, each with a different style of terrain and different obstacles. Players navigate through ten levels and a base, where they must safely make it through the level and remove the booty.
