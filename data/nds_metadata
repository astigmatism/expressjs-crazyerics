They were drawn by the Creator, who also drew their world and everything upon it.

Along the way, you meet her best friend, Jowee, and her father, the Mayor. These characters are the last remaining villagers. You design a hero for them, and then run into Wilfre, a corrupted Raposa that dabbled in creation, and spawned a legion of evil shadow-like creatures. \n \nWill you be able to save the Raposa race and their village, or will the shadow creatures take over the whole village?\n\nDrawn to Life: The Next Chapter follows the same concept as the first game, taking place after an unkown amount of time following the first game.\n\nThe game begins with a surreal sequence, wherein an unknown party asks the player “What do you remember about that day?” The player is given several dialogue choices that build a cohesive description of \"that day\", though at this time, the player is not aware of the event's importance (or even occurrence). Before the game properly begins, the player is asked to draw an image depicting this mysterious scene, introducing them to the game's core \"draw\" functionality.\n\nFollowing this is an animation sequence wherein one of the characters from the previous game, Heather, recovers from a nightmare. She is shown to possess a red-colored jewel pendant. In the same sequence, Heather is abducted by a darkness which emanated from a scepter she discovered in a beached treasure chest in the middle of the night. The next morning, when the other characters realize she's missing, a search for her is dramatically cut short by Wilfre, who causes the majority of the Raposa villagers to vanish, reveals himself as Heather's captor, and ultimately drains the Village of color. The remaining characters flee to the back of a massive turtle delivered, upon request, by the Creator.\n\nTheir numbers sorely reduced and their home ruined, the game follows the Raposa's struggle to reunite with their fellows and, with the aid of the Creator's Hero of Creation, defeat Wilfre before he can realize his as-yet unknown goals. The remaining members of the Village travel to Watersong, Lavasteam, the Galactic Jungle, and Wilfre's Wasteland, a combination of all three villages.","MaxPlayers":"1","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"97239","CommunityRating":"3.5","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawn_to_Life","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Platform","Developer":"5th Cell","Publisher":"THQ"},"Dream Chronicles":{"Name":"Dream Chronicles","ReleaseDate":"2010-03-09T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Dream Chronicles is an unusual casual puzzle/adventure game that assigns the player the role of Faye, a young woman, whose husband, Fidget, has been whisked away via magical means by Lilith, a mysterious fairy.

The place is in need of reform, so the things found inside are sold in a yard sale to fund the renovation.\n\nFabulous Finds is a hidden object game with elements from other games. The game is divided in three main sections. The first is a hidden object challenge with a time limit, where the player has to search for objects on rooms from the house, to sell them later. Instead of the usual list at the side of the screen with names of required items, the game shows slots to store a general type of object, and the player has to click on things that correspond to the category or theme (for example, \"Babies and Kids\" for toys, \"Yard and Garden\" for gardening tools, and so on). Some objects need an extra item to make them work, like power chords and batteries, before they can be collected.\n\nNext comes the yard sale, shown in a isometric view, with all the items set on tables and the customers roaming around them. A list at the left side shows clues to what every patron wants (\"woman in red wants to cart some rocks\"). The player has to drag and drop the customers to their items.\n\nThe final component is the decoration screen, where the money accumulated on the yard sale is spent on curtains, floor covers, furniture and other things. Clues appear that indicate the necessary items to improve the final rating, that goes up to 5 stars. Sometimes, a mini-game appears where objects have to be collected in the boxes of a storeroom","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"129627","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo DS","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":{}},"Fairyland Melody Magic":{"Name":"Fairyland - Melody Magic","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"155446","Platform":"Nintendo DS","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{}},"Family Park Tycoon":{"Name":"Family Park Tycoon","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-17T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Family Park Tycoon is a business simulation video game for the Nintendo DS developed by VIS Games and Entertainment, a division of Visual Imagination Games and Software, and published by Astragon.

Contract additional mercenaries as you explore, capture, and hold new territory so the natives can harvest the valuable trees from which a revolutionary medicine can be extracted. The more trees you hold, the more money you make. The more money you have, the more you can do, such as hire native guards, hire more mercs, in order to take the offense and clear the sector of enemies. You will also need to retrieve certain objects from behind enemy lines, rescue captured personnel, capture equipment, and more. Hire a good mechanic in order to get your equipment and guns repaired, and to \"enhance\" them with various add-ons. Travel through lush jungles, treacherous rivers (with venomous snakes!), and more as you seek to free Metavira. Eventually, you'll meet up with the bad guys' leader in his compound for the final showdown...\n\nJagged Alliance is a turn-based tactical combat game with a mixture of strategy, reminiscent of X-Com games. On the \"strategic view\", you get to see the various sectors of Metavira. You start with just one sector, with a few trees for your income. You need to hold more sectors in order to increase the number of trees you hold, which will increase your income. You can hire/fire mercs. \n\nEach merc can move or shoot or perform any of the other actions as long as they sitll have action points. Each of the mercenaries have personality. Some work well with others, others won't. You'll need shooters (both long and short guns), explosive experts (to set/disarm bombs/traps), mechanics/gunsmiths (fix/modify your equipment), doctors/nurses (to heal wounded mercs). Each merc has a different price, so you'll need to balance what you can afford vs. what you need. Manage the equipment as well. \n\nIf you move into an enemy-held sector, the game moves to combat mode, where you get an over-head slightly-isometric turn-based tactical combat that's based on \"action points\", which limits the amount of action each merc can perform. You can do this, or that, but not both. The action continues until the sector is no longer contested (either one side got wiped out, or retreated to another sector, or both). \n\nAfter the sector is clear, you can call in native guards to \"hold\" the sector (you need to pay for them as well) as well as hire more natives to process the \"new\" trees. You will also need to get the mercs to the homebase if any one was wounded, and let the doctor/nurse treat them. Idle mercs at the base can train to improve their ratings. Some scripted events and some random events will keep you busy such as poisoned water, a virus that attacks the trees, kidnapped daughter of chief, and others. \n\nSo to summarize, you need to manage the mercs (and their salary), their equipment (who gets what), arrange for backup (mercs at base) and medical treatment (doctor/nurse) while taking into account their personalities and strengths. You also need to manage the strategic aspects as you need to \"conquer\" each sector and then send enough guards to hold the sector after you retrieve the mercs. You manage the money as you need to balance the expenditures (mercs, equipment, guards, natives, etc.) against the income (the trees). You also get to manage the tactical aspects of the battle as you decide each move and shot. A full complement of mercenary supplies (from revolvers to M-16s, plus bombs, grenades, mines, flak jackets, helmets, and more) are available.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"130059","Platform":"Nintendo DS","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{}},"Jam Sessions":{"Name":"JAM Sessions","ReleaseDate":"2007-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"Jam Sessions is a reworked and localized version of the Japan-only DS title Hiite Utaeru DS Guitar M-06.

Simulating a guitar, the game part allows players to go through a list of famous songs. The chords are selected on the D-pad while the stylus is used to simulate strumming on the screen. Alternately, the L-button can be used to strum. The details are worked out thoroughly - speed and power change the sound, and downstrokes sound different from upstrokes. With only one strum string shown, only chord progression can be performed and no individual riffing or picking. The game does not punish players for not doing well, songs just keep on going regardless of the player's performance. There is a tutorial and warm up mode to get familiar with the controls.\n\nAs a tool, it allows players to compose their own songs and add a variety of effects. These include distortion, low cut, high cut, delay, chorus and flanger with extensive settings for each of them. These can be set invariably or made touch-specific. When using headphones or external speakers, the DS microphone can be used to sing along. Additionally, the DS can be plugged in to an amplifier via the headphone jack to output a more natural sound.

Due to the limited screen size of the handheld, the grid size of the levels had to be cut down from 14x14 to 12x12 tiles, thus forcing a complete redesign of all the levels. While at it the developers added some DS-only gameplay options like the new magical storm where the player can blow into the microphone to reshuffle the jewels. \n\nThe basic idea of Jewel Match comes from Bejeweled / Diamond Mine - the player is presented with a grid of jewels. By swapping pairs of tiles which are next to each other, rows of three or more identical jewels can be formed that will disappear instantly, giving points to the player and making room for other gems falling from above to take their place. The levels have gaps and shaped areas, though, so pieces do not simply fall vertically but also can fall diagonally.\n\nJewel Match has its own victory criterion though. On each of the 150 levels, a selection of squares have gold or even silver backings. One match (gold) or two (silver) must be created over each of these against a ticking clock to clear the level. Later in the game there are jewels tied to their square with a golden or silver chain, which thus are not falling down and blocking empty squares beneath them. These jewels can be freed by matching them once or twice, too, which means that the most difficult squares must be matched four times (silver chain and silver background) to be cleared.\n\nA succession of hammers are unlocked once you have scored a certain amount of points. The first removes a particular jewel, the second not only removes the gem but also any effects (background or chains) on the square, and the final one removes all gems of that colour. Another extra to be unlocked is a magical storm that will have the player blow into the DS microphone to mix up the jewels. Moreover, matching more than three jewels in a row will create gems with special powers. Matching four will create a joker gem while matching five gives a gem that, once activated, will destroy the whole row it is in. \n\nThe game also offers a hot seat mode where two players can play the same level right after another, competing for the better clearing time.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"130068","CommunityRating":"5","Platform":"Nintendo DS","CommunityRatingCount":"2","Genres":{}},"Jewel Match 2":{"Name":"Jewel Match 2","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"152085","Platform":"Nintendo DS","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{}},"Jewel Match 3":{"Name":"Jewel Match 3","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"152084","Platform":"Nintendo DS","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{}},"Jewel Quest Solitaire Trio":{"Name":"Jewel Quest Solitaire Trio","Overview":"Love Solitaire?

The final round sees Laval facing off against Cragger, who uses an elongated lance to win the duel. Laval is annoyed that Cragger keeps \"cheating his way to victory\". Shortly after the tournament has ended, a bright light is seen at the top of nearby Spiral Mountain. Laval ascends the mountain, and, at the peak, finds Cragger with a machine containing both the Golden Chi orb and a multitude of ordinary Chi orbs, which will threaten to overload and disrupt the balance of the Chi if activated. Laval fights and defeats Cragger, but is unable to prevent the activation of the machine. Cragger boasts that, with the Chi out of balance, he will soon possess \"triple Chi power\", before making his escape.\n\nLaval reports back to his father, but they receive word that the eagle and gorilla tribes are under attack. Laval heads into each tribe's territory to fight off the aggressors (the wolf and raven tribes, respectively), and rescue the captured (including his friends Eris and Gorzan), but each time the aggressor tribe gets away with a piece of the legendary Triple-Chi Armour.\n\nNext, Cragger leads an attack on the Lion Temple, eventually kidnapping Lagravis in order to find the final piece of the armour. Laval meets up with his friends, including Worriz, who wants to get back at Cragger for supposedly betraying the wolf tribe by keeping the power of the triple Chi armour for himself. They enter rhino territory to find out more about the armour, and battle Cragger once again, eventually leading them to Crocodile territory. Here Cragger breaks free of Crooler's control, and joins the others to fight his sister and rescue Lagravis. Worriz takes the full set of armour for himself, after learning that its true power can be activated at the top of Spiral Mountain.\n\nThe team ascends Spiral Mountain, under heavy guard by the wolf tribe, and eventually find Worriz at the peak, unable to control himself (caused both by the power of the armour and the full moon). Laval and his friends fight and defeat Cragger, and Eris recites the legend of the armour, that its power must be used when the Chi is unbalanced, to restore the land to normal. Laval realizes that he is partially to blame; Cragger set the trap, but he ran straight into it. Impressed that his son has started to realize his own limitations, Lagravis dons the armour and uses its power to restore the balance of the Chi and fix the damage caused to the land.\n\nUnfortunately, Crooler appears and reinfects Cragger with her persuader plant. They escape, but Lagravis is content with the fact that the Chi balance has been restored, saying that the lion tribe will continue to protect it.","MaxPlayers":"2","Cooperative":"true","DatabaseID":"149594","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Legends_of_Chima:_Laval%27s_Journey","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Developer":"TT Fusion","Publisher":"Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment"},"LEGO Marvel Super Heroes Universe in Peril":{"Name":"Lego Marvel Super Heroes: Universe in Peril","ReleaseDate":"2014-02-18T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"LEGO Marvel Super Heroes offers an original storyline in which Nick Fury calls upon Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, Wolverine and other heroes spanning the Marvel Universe to save Earth from such threats as the vengeance of Loki and the hunger of Galactus, Devourer of the Worlds.

Set a thousand years before previous storylines, Lunar Genesis tells the tale of a band of young adventurers performing courier jobs who stumble into a battle between the forces of good and evil. This battle threatens to consume the entire land and sets the stage for over 70 hours of handheld RPG adventuring.\n\nWith all of the standard features associated with a traditional Japanese RPG, Lunar Genesis is adapted perfectly to take advantage of the benefits afforded by the Nintendo DS hardware. All aspects of player interaction, from movement around the game environments to map and menu navigation can be controlled via the touch-screen. Both displays are employed throughout the game to make sure the player has access to all the information they need. The dual screens are also fundamental to the battle system, with airborne enemies occupying the upper screen and traditional ground-based troops on the bottom. Even the microphone is used, as blowing on it during a fight acts as a 'panic button'.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting feature for series fans and newcomers alike is the inclusion of the Coliseum mode, a wireless multiplayer battle where scratch cards earned during the single-player quest can be used to take on other players. The participants literally scratch off squares on the touch-screen, the outcome of which dictates the flow of combat. The winner gets to keep the loser's card for use in further Coliseum battles or to aid them in their single-player questing.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"99411","CommunityRating":"4","WikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar:_Dragon_Song","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Role-Playing","Developer":"Japan Art Media","Publisher":"Rising Star Games"},"Lunar Knights":{"Name":"Lunar Knights","ReleaseDate":"2007-02-06T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"Descend into the gothic Sci-Fi world of Lunar Knights and take control of two warriors on a quest to reclaim the world from the vampiric legion.

This wheel's look is different from that of the Wii Wheel from Mario Kart Wii.[1]\n\nPlayable characters include Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, Gloria the Hippotamus, The Penguins, The Chimps, and King Julien from the Madagascar. Two characters from other movies are included alongside the Madagascar, Shrek from Shrek, and B.O.B. from Monsters vs. Aliens, all DreamWorks Animation franchises. Race types include Quick Race, Championship, Time Trial and Checkpoint race. A Championship race is one where the player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial, players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out. There are several tracks in the game. Also, in a track, most tracks have 2 shortcuts. \"I Like to Move It\", sung by Reel 2 Real, is the menu theme.

With less and less children reading fairy tales, people will forget the stories and Fairy Tale World will disappear forever. The monsters who feature in all of the fairy tale stories don't like this at all, so they take it upon themselves to rescue their world.\n\nMonster Puzzle is a puzzle game similar to Zoo Keeper or Bejeweled. You have a set grid of monsters that can be dragged with the stylus either left and right or up and down (up to a maximum of three spaces). If you match at least three monsters horizontally or vertically, that row of monsters will disappear. If you match up a 2x2 square of monsters, a 4x4 square of monsters will be deleted.\n\nUnlike Zoo Keeper and Bejeweled, the goal is not to just eliminate monsters. Instead, players must 'claim' spaces where the monsters lie, which is done when you clear a set of monsters. In most stages, you will just need to claim the space once (which turns it orange), but in later stages, you will need to claim space twice (which turns orange spaces to red). After a certain percentage of space is claimed, the player moves onto the next stage.\n\nThe game can also be played in versus mode with a friend. In this mode, the player who runs out of time first is the loser. Time can be added by continuing to clear monsters. If you clear multiple monsters simultaneously, a rock will appear on the opponent's screen which makes it more difficult for them to clear monsters.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"127994","Platform":"Nintendo DS","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{}},"Monster Racers":{"Name":"Monster Racers","ReleaseDate":"2010-05-11T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"In Monster Racers, players embark on a quest that will take them around the globe in search of monster breeds to train, nurture and race.

Her Majesty wishes to know more about this odd place, and requests the Master Detective's help to crack the case. The Queen offers a single lead: the diary of a young woman named Emma Ravenhearst, who traveled to Blackpool from Iowa over a century earlier.\n\nThe Master Detective travels to Ravenhearst and begins to explore. Many of the doors are indeed locked with Rube Goldberg device-esque puzzles that the sleuth must solve to break the seals and search the whole mansion for clues. Successfully finding these clues allows the Detective to assemble more entries from Emma's diary, detailing the courtship of a handsome young man named Charles Dalimar, her reluctant refusal of his marriage proposal, her attempt to return to Iowa upon news of her father's illness, and her gradual descent into a strange, seemingly incurable malady. Charles insisted on having Emma recuperate in his newly built mansion, which he names in her honor in an attempt to convince her to stay in England rather than go home. Emma agrees, but notices that Charles is becoming increasingly distant and interested in texts on black magic.\n\nAs the Master Detective continues to open Ravenhearst's doors, it becomes clear that all is not right in the manor: ghostly whispers and wails are heard throughout the halls, and several of the rooms--locked for over a hundred years--contain anachronistic technology that Charles could not have obtained when the mansion was originally built. Emma's diary entries similarly take a turn for the worse as she describes her increasingly severe sickness, bizarre dreams, and odd lack of correspondence from her family. To soothe her, Charles hires a nursemaid named Rose Somerset to clean the house and tend to Emma. The two women become friends, but Rose soon begins informing Emma of Charles's increasingly dangerous behavior, culminating in her spotting a bottle of white phosphorus--the key ingredient of dangerous poison--in the man's pocket.\n\nEmma realizes that Charles has been keeping her sick, and that the locks he has been installing on the doors are a method to keep her bound inside the mansion's walls forever. She and Rose make plans to flee, but it seems in vain, as the penultimate diary entry the Master Detective constructs contains an image of Charles standing over Emma with a hatchet. The sleuth assembles the final torn page, written by none other than Emma's ghost. She has been magically sealed in the house since her murder, and only the Master Detective can lay her to rest. By finding seven skeleton keys hidden throughout the manor and solving a final puzzle, the sleuth breaks the last lock, discovers Emma's coffin, and opens it, freeing her spirit and lifting the curse on the mansion.

These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.\n\nWhen an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to \"offset\" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.\n\nThe game features a two-player mode.

Instead of swapping adjacent tiles to create groups of three or more like in the earlier title, the main gameplay mechanic this time is to move columns and rows to match tiles.\n\nThe player controls a hero character, moving between waypoints in an isometric map similar to the ones found on the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade and defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.\n\nThe battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the combatants take turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid.\n\nThe troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of their colors.\n\nNew troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines, taverns, dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on a set number of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges. Completing these bonus stages gives new items and upgrades.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"13698","CommunityRating":"4.5","Platform":"Nintendo DS","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Puzzle"},"Puzzle Quest 2":{"Name":"Puzzle Quest 2","ReleaseDate":"2010-06-22T00:00:00-07:00","Overview":"This game features its hallmark blend of match-3 gem matching and fantasy, with a simple but meaningful role playing experience where players can choose any of four character classes; War Mage, Inquisitor, Barbarian or Assassin.

Players select a character to farm a piece of land alongside three other characters. The farmland is made up of a 7x5 grid with each grid of soil being able to be seeded. The gameplay flow typically involves the player selecting an item from the action bar on the side, this is usually the seed first so that it can be planted. After a seed is planted, it needs to be watered and fertilized twice, which will allow the crop to grow so that it can be harvested and earn the player points. Harvesting itself can be done by either using a basket for automatic results or by rubbing the stylus over a crop.. Now, since the action bar only holds six actions at a time, some may prove not worthwhile during a particular moment and so in order to make more room, can be deleted from the action bar at the cost of points from the players score. \n\nEach character has a color to differentiate their crop square from their opponent. Planting a seed changes a crop square to their color. If a player plants crops on both sides of an opponents crop square, the square in between will change its color and become the players. While all crops are able to be harvested, harvesting crops the same color of the player are worth twice as much as the others. However, if an X appears over a player's crop, only the player can harvest that crop for the brief time the X exists.\n\nAnimals can also be selected from the action bar. Normal animals will effect a 2x2 area, while gold versions of these animals will effect the whole playfield. Animals such as chickens who eat seeds and dogs that can prevent others from harvesting can be deployed.\n\nThe game takes place over the four seasons which changes what crops get harvested, and when the time runs out, the player with the highest score wins.\n\nThe game features a single player mode and a multiplayer mode, Game types include a normal mode which is a free for all between four competitors, a 2 vs.2 mode where competitors form two different teams to go against each other, a quota mode where the game tells the players what random crop is worth the most points to harvest at that time, and survival mode, which requires the player to keep scoring first place finishes in order to keep going. Play options include selecting the amount of time a game lasts, selecting the difficulty of the player's computer controlled opponents, and selecting the player's color.\n\nThe game keeps track of the players high scores and also offers a tutorial.mode which just explains the games rules through text and visuals. The game also has options to turn the background music and sound effects on or off.

The objective of the source material is to reach the top of each level, taking out any enemies in the way by firing magical rainbows that can trap or eliminate foes as well as providing bridges for the player to walk on. Rainbows remain onscreen for a short amount of time but can be ?broken? by the player if they jump on them. Once broken, the rainbow will fall off the screen, taking out the first enemy it touches. The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels. The objective is still to reach the top of the level, but the time limit has been extended to account for the player being unable to move and use rainbows simultaneously. Rainbows are now broken by pressing the stylus onto them.","MaxPlayers":"4","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"27834","CommunityRating":"1","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"1","Genres":"Action; Platform","Developer":"Marvelous Entertainment","Publisher":"Codemasters"},"Ram Racing":{"Name":"Ram Racing","Overview":"Nothing says \"power\" and \"performance\" like the legendary Ram brand.

Basic moves include upper block, body block, dodging left and right, short punches and powered punches (hook, jab, uppercut, bodyshot). While playing, there are a few parameters to take into account. First there is a health meter that recharges when the boxer dodges hits for some time. Punches need to be thrown strategically, as an energy bar determines the effectiveness. Too many punches deplete the bar and the amount also determines if a boxer will be able to get up when knocked down. A round timer and knockdown lights are also shown. At certain times, a power-up indicator will become available. This allows a boxer to charge a heavy punch, but the opponent will have time to react. When the charging takes too long, the punch is lost.\n\nThe different game modes (different for heavyweight and welterweight) include:\nSingle Fights (Quick): fight for only one round until one of the boxers is knocked out.\n\nSingle Fights (Regular): play for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rounds and choose to decide it by a KO, TKO or by points.\n\nPoints System: after each round each boxer is awarded points based on performance. At the end of a fight, or after a KO or TKO, the player with the most points wins.\n\nBelts: series of three (Amateur), four (Contender) or six (Showtime) fights. Each fight lasts four rounds or three minutes and the aim is to win one of the belts.\n\nKing of the Ring: one boxer takes on all other boxers in his weight division in one long round.\nAdditional fighters are unlocked by winning competitions.

The player then marks off squares on the card if they contain numbers from the spin. Jokers can also show up during spins which allow the player to mark off any square from the column.\n\nPlayers can get extra points for various feats, such as clearing the entire card. Different cards have different Slingo patterns highlighted in red that are worth extra points if the player marks every square.

The player and the pirate take turns spinning on the same board. Occasionally, a treasure chest pops up which may contain treasure or it may confiscate treasure.

If you'd rather write the number in, you can change to this setting which replaces the keypad with a blank area in which you can write your number.\n\nTo help move you on up to the more difficult puzzles, the game offers different highlighting tools to help you work your way around the board faster. If you tap a number in the grid twice, Sudoku Gridmaster highlights every instance of that number in the 9x9 grid. This lets you quickly recognize which 3x3 square still needs the number you tapped. A number will appear 9 times in the grid. In the easier puzzles, this feature alone will help you know out many squares quickly.\n\nWhen you tap a square once, an orange highlight appears, lighting up the 3x3 square in which you're currently working and the lines that intersect the square you tapped. This feature helps a ton when your deductive reasoning skills are called upon in the medium and hard puzzles. A combination of the two highlighting features can be very helpful when you're trying to solve a real doozy.\n\nThe faster you complete a puzzle, the more stars you win.

The currency used in the game is called gotchi.\n\nThe game begins with the player choosing a four-letter name, with the suffix \"-tchi\" automatically added to the end to define the player as a Tamagotchi, like the rest of the characters. After choosing one of three potential partners, a short scene is featured in with the player's chosen partner reveals that they have won the Tamagotchi Lottery, with prize money of 10,000 gotchi which are used to purchase shops.\n\nIn this game, many of the Tamagotchis from the first game return, while some do not. Many of the new ones are from Tamagotchi Connection V4, Tamagotchi School, and Uratama. At the beginning of the game, the player must choose a name and a partner. There are three potential partners: Memetchi, Kuchipatchi, and Mametchi.\n\nTamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop 2 features twelve playable shops that are played through screen interaction. After serving a customer at each shop, the player is paid an amount of gotchi and is given a review. The possible reviews are Try Harder, meaning that the service was inadequate, Great Job, meaning that the service was satisfactory yet not perfect, and Awesome Job, meaning that the service was completed completely towards the customer's standards. Each time the player serves a customer and is paid, the shop's reputation rises depending on their review. When the reputation rises to a certain level, Princess Tamako pays a visit, and once she is served she offers to renovate the shop. There are four shop levels: The first level is Puchi, which is the stage the shop is in when it is first bought, whereas the following levels are Metchi, Gotchi, and Royal.\n\nWhen the player first purchases a shop, only four of the twelve are available: Cake Shop, Burger Shop, Flower Shop and Gas Station. After boosting one or numerous shops to certain stages, an additional six shops are made available: Flight, Concert Hall, Clinic, Boutique, Bowling, and Sushi Bar. The final two shops are Sushi-Bowl and Music Clinic; the Sushi-Bowl can only be unlocked by boosting both the Sushi Bar and the Bowling shop to the Royal Stage, whereas the Music Clinic can only be unlocked through boosting both the Concert Hall and Clinic to royal. The combined Sushi-Bowl and Music Clinic do not require going through the Metchi and Gotchi stages in order to become royal; after the first visit from Princess Tamako, she renovates the shop from putchi to royal.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"148236","Platform":"Nintendo DS","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{}},"Tangled":{"Name":"Tangled","ReleaseDate":"2010-11-23T00:00:00-08:00","Overview":"The Nintendo DS version of Tangled (based on the 2010 Walt Disney Animated Classic film of the same name) plays similarly to its home console cousins, except that the gameplay's side-view appears 2D rather than the 3D experience of the console versions.\n\nThe gameplay consists of helping Rapunzel completing several tasks for many characters from the film, primarily by using the Nintendo DS stylus to collect certain objects as well as tapping these characters to talk with them.

Shown from a top-down/third-person view, Hue needs to dodge enemies and can roll into paint to absorb it. This leaves behind a trail of paint.

There is a puzzle element to the game as this technique is for instance used to create platforms that lead to higher levels.

Now, with the aid of her robotic butler Cromwell and her short but helpful assistant Funghi, she sets out to earn her reputation as the Touch Detective. She'll chase down a stolen dream, search for a missing person, and more, as she attempts to become well known for her detecting skills.\n\nTouch Detective is an adventure game in the style of later Sierra adventure games such as Space Quest 6. Players navigate Mackenzie through various screens by touching the area where they want her to move. Mackenzie can interact with certain on-screen objects with another tap of the stylus - depending on the object, she may look at it, pick it up, talk to it (if it can strike up a conversation), or even touch it to see what it feels like. Mackenzie likes to feel objects to understand them, which is why she's the 'Touch' Detective. Mackenzie can also check and combine objects in her inventory.\n\nThe top screen of the DS always has a close-up of Mackenzie herself. As she talks to other characters, observes objects and so forth, the top screen will display Mackenzie's thoughts - so while she may say one thing to a person (\"Sure, I get it...\"), she'll be thinking another (\"What was that? I wasn't listening!\"). It can be interesting (and sometimes insightful) to see the contrast between what Mackenzie says and what she thinks.\n\nTouch Detective features four different 'cases' for Mackenzie to tackle. After the first case is completed, players can also choose to take on the Bonus Case. In this case, there is no main story, but Mackenzie can choose to take on small requests from characters, as well as increase her Touch List, which records the feeling of particular objects in the game world.","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"12541","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"0","Genres":{}},"Touch Mechanic":{"Name":"Touch Mechanic","Overview":"Touch Mechanic takes players into the exciting world of customs and car tuning.

At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.\n\nThe game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's own graphical theme.\n\nThe second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up. However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.\n\nThe third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful.

As in the previous game, the main goal is to clear a series of marble strings by matching three or more balls of the same color. The spheres roll on twisting tracks that occupy most of the screen, appearing from one side and moving towards the gaping mouth of a golden skull. The player controls a frog that is either stationed near the tracks or moving sideways at the bottom. The amphibian holds one of the colored balls in its open mouth, and a reserve one inside its body.\n\nThe main Adventure Mode is divided in sequential zones, each with several levels. The main objective of each level is to aim and shoot at the moving lines to make three-of-a-kind color matches and fill a meter at the top to finish. If three or more balls enter the exit hole, the player loses one life and the level has to be replayed. When all lives are spent, the whole zone has to be restarted from the latest automatic checkpoint, usually at mid-point.\n\nSome of the spheres are marked with icons and have power-ups that can be activated with matches. The bomb explodes all the surrounding spheres, the reticule improves shot accuracy by giving temporary laser targeting sights to the frog, the rewind arrow pushes all the marbles backwards, the hand slowdowns movement for some seconds, the lightning bolt vaporizes all the balls of one color, the tri-shot fires three cannon balls that destroy anything in their path and the laser surgically removes single spheres. Some levels have pairs of lily pads, and the frog can jump between them to eliminate all the marbles.\n\nA boss battle happens at the end of each zone, where the opponent is an idol mask that keeps moving sideways at the top. The frog moves at the bottom and has to hit the enemy with several spheres to defeat it, while at the same time matching the moving line of spheres to clear the field. Each boss has a different attack and defense strategy, throwing enchantment shots at the frog and putting obstacles and minions to block the area.\n\nBesides Adventure Mode, there are three additional modes that are gradually unlocked as the levels are completed in the main game. In Challenge Mode, the objective is to achieve a high score under three minutes. The top meter is replaced by a bonus gauge that slowly fills with every match. When it is full, it transforms one of the spheres into a multiplier that gives bonus points after being matched.

The INKT Corporation. as before, manages to drain all colour from the city and also turns its inhabitants, the Raydians, into generic drones. Once again, it is up to Blob and the members of the Colour Underground to restore the city to its vibrant former glory. Blob frees the lands one by one, as he did in the last game, fighting against many foes, including a massive monster created in a factory accident, as he approaches Comrade Black. Black, however, is shown to be more clever than was suggested in the previous game. At one point, he kidnaps the other members of the Color Underground. Once De Blob frees all of Prisma City, he confronts Comrade Black again, only to discover, as he flees to space once again, that Black had used Blob's own journey against him, using color beacons that were mysteriously activated as Blob progressed to power an orbiting satellite to enslave the entire planet. As Blob gets closer and closer, Black taunts him and forces him to make a series of choices: continue on, or rescue a few Graydians that Black had placed in biodomes rigged to explode and risk running out of time. Once Blob finally reaches him, Black uses a high-power beam of color to grow gigantic and fight Blob.","MaxPlayers":"4","Cooperative":"false","DatabaseID":"9072","CommunityRating":"3","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ESRB":"E - Everyone","CommunityRatingCount":"3","Genres":"Platform","Developer":"Halfbrick Studios","Publisher":"THQ"},"iCarly":{"Name":"iCarly","Overview":"Join the cast of iCarly!\n\n\n\nJoin the cast of iCarly!
